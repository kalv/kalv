Over the last couple of months, I've noticed a shift in my expectation on how fast software needs to be. I took a moment to think through it. I feel this is because of some new technology that is available and over time is going to change the way we perceive what fast is and whether the service we're using is 'good'.

Sure I might be too much of a life hacker, someone that is in persuit of ever optimized productivity and interactions with digital services, so I understand that this might not matter to others.

Some history, make web fast and other aspects on why performance is important.

Over the last year, I got an iPad pro which now has 120hz pro motion, super smooth, using an old ipad now feels janky. Then the iPhone 13 pro which also has the faster pro motion. And now the Macbook pro powered by M1 and also pro motion.

The fact that when I open my macbook lid now, the screen instanly wakes u (talking about really really low ms), I expect the next iteraction to be instant also. So when loading up websites that I normally would've expected are fast now feel slow.

Even using a note taking app that I want to quickly capture something, needs to feel instant and have less interaction points/clicks.

An interested side pro point was that using email now is fast again for me. I've been trying to consolidate my cloud services, and found that icloud+ can now support custom domains, so am testing that out. An interesting side effect was this wow feeling on how snappy the email scrolling was, the search for all my email is instant

Changing the game, everything is instant, so now things that were fast now feel slow.

Things were smooth feel janky. Similar to me picking up an older iPad, itâ€™s not as smooth.

### What can we do about it

As web developers, what can we do about it. Here are some trends and things I've started to see.

Reduce the renders, web components!! Link to article.

Consider how much data and state is composed on the front end.

Where is push content changes over HTTP/3.

Look to precompiling ahead of time, hydrating when required.
