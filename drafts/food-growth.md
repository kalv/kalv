Going to require more thought and work on this one.

Compost growth (might be unclean but so are mushrooms)

water and hydration of the soil and allowing for growth
Evolution of greenhouses. Mini ones.


Higher protein from beans. Cooked longer and then left to soak after. Not to be confused with soaking the beans first. Haven't been able to scientifically analyze, but in my tests, a good bowl of soup made from these beans, cooked and soaked becomes a filling meal. Similiar to dhals and other forms of indian dishes.

beans / legumes, last a long time.

rice - 25C to 35C, if 50-85 days growth is quite quick, so what would happen if there are small batches of rice being grown in a tent for those in rural places.

photosynthesize acceleration - funneling the right sunshine ? maybe share.

Watercress can be grown in an egg with some cotton wool as it's soil, just requires water and the cotton wool to allow it's roots to hydrate. Not sure if you've eaten a watercress egg sandwich, but it's lovely. So if watercress can be grown with just this water, what else can.

microgreens, such as beets, chard, and many herbs, may take 16â€“25 days to

What happens if you're in an area that is hot but doesn't have water. Well could it be as simple as lining to plastic sheets together and allowing the codensation to form between the lining. Where the outside would be hot and the inside of the lining would be cooler. In sandy regions this could be done on the ground as the heat is above the ground and lower in the ground it would be cooler. The material used on the inside lining could be a colour that it doesn't radiate the heat as much. Reflective heat material like foil based (similiar to what is used in foil insulation.

Tent irrigation water lining
