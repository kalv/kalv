## 2023


## 2024

It's been a while since I've written a full post of an update to the internet on what I've been up to and my thoughts around what has happened to me over the last 2 years as truths for my friends and family. Those that are really left, you'll understand when you read this post.

This is going to be I think, the largest post I've ever made to kick off 2025.

- Travelling exploring BC further for my research on what I'm working
- Finding the right neighbourhood in Vancouver that I'd feel welcome.
- The bad incidents that have made me believe that Canada is a fucking shit country and the commonwealth

Airbnb being good and then being really bad with just the hosts in Vancouver, all evicting me for false reasons, no matter how many times I tried to be kind and caring to the hosts they always threw me out. Nothing to do with AirBnB at all really they had to use their process and act with the rules they had. But one specific case made me no longer use AirBnB anymore. I made banana bread for a host in North Vancouver, after arriving to the neighbourhood when a neighbour walked past saying "This is a lovely neighbourhood", and was made very welcome when I first arrived but then 2 days later, she was very very mean to me, accusing me of being loud at nigh when talking through my notes downstairs which is completely ok for a guest to do at a place they rent out. Then giving me permission to smoke outside in the garden but then the next day stating that i'm smoking in the property and aggresively messaged me multiple times making me run to another home. Truly appalled that North Vancouver residents are this evil to evict a man from a booked reservation. I didn't complain or fight it, I just walked away to another lovely home that I live in now, Burnaby. Of which I love this city, there are a lot of immigrants and they seem to be really happy with what they have.

Summer sucked, I was attacked by an RCMP officer, an incident this year that really broke me. To walk outside in the neighbourhood of White Rock in Vancouver, I was asked to take things out of my pocket on the hood of his car, and then just started to attack me with no reason, explanation or anything. 
It started when I was scouting properties to buy and was boxed in with other cars very voilenty. So I locked my car and left the car there. Walked home, which was an AirBnB around the corner to get myself together because there were two cars, two men and a lady claiming I was on private property when I was just parking my car on a road. Then had no way to get out. After walking home, I cooled myself down and wanted to get back to get my laptop as it had all my researh on it. That is when the police officer was there and just attacked me.

What I was most upset in this is that when I reached out to close friends and told them that I was attacked violently they didn't care. And all just told me to go the hospital to remove the bolts that the ER docter put in my head instead of stiches. But that was ok, i wanted to get out of the hospital as fast as I could before they did anything else to me. So left with my T-shirt only and no police record, they didn't even take my name. The nerve of the police officer, returned to ask me how many stitches I had in my head as though it was an acheivement for him. Not even a sorry or an explanation on why they attacked me. Only to tell me that my car had been taken to a tow company that I now had to pay to pick up. 

What is also shocking about the whole incident is that they walked away with my headphones and torch that I took out of my pocket, and stole them. They were not returned. They did though return another rack sack that I didn't own at the hospital and I said to them in front of the staff at the hospital that this is not my bag, and didn't want to ask him where my other possessions were out of fear they'd hurt me even more.

They left me in a decision room bleeding for 3 hours before even tending to my wound or even giving me any water. I was appalled and shocked at the treatment of a hospital to treat me after being attacked innnocently from an RCMP officer.
After recovering on this, I was afraid to even go back to the hospital for care. After they used staples in my head rather than stitches which they did do on the injury on my leg, which was a 3 inch open wound. One that the police officer made with something attached to his foot when he kicked me.
I'm sharing all this transparently to get it off my chest, as today in 2025, I'm moving on. Just now ignoring the RCMP.

What I'll also share which is crazy, is that I reported my items stolen through the official RCMP website that my items were stolen by a police officer but knew very well that they wouldn't reply. And they hadn't. I still have the criminal case number but know they won't do anything.
A couple of days after the incident I was feeling up to see the real world an went for a starbucks and was very scared to see at the same trip, the first one since being beaten up, there were 2 RCMP police cars at the exact Starbucks I put into my Apple maps to go to. It was no coincidence, so I returned home not wanting to go any coffee shop anymore. To recover I stayed in homes watching movies, self medicating for the pain and healing myself without any help. Of which Uber Eats was very helpful until my Visa and other forms of payment stopped working. Of which I don't care, these financial systems seem to be very brittle.

One last thing to mention with my stay at White Rock was the fact that my Apple HomePod started to work. Very bizzare from a computer scientist. It seemed that there was an Wifi SSID called "Kalv" somewhere in the neighbourhood, the music started to just play and stream on the homepod. One that only plays music that is connected to Apple Music over the internet. I checked with a laptop to see if the WIFI ssid was visible but not all. So I quickly turned off the home pod and threw it my car not wanting to know anymore.

Cancellation of things - Paypal not working, Visa card, Amazon orders being removed from my transanctions after buying some watches I wanted to give my children at christmas.

Family update, they've all left me, my children don't talk to me. Last year I stayed 5 minutes walk away from them in Pitt Meadows hoping I would be able to access my children anytime I want. I literally as living to my daughters high school and my wife refused multiple times for me to acces them. I don't like fighting in front of my children on topics like this, so have decided to move away from them as they are happier with their mother. Of which I respect.

Staying in Port Moody
- Shit ton of shit

BC parks
- All crap - dying

They are all dicks, brew row

coffee shop - revolver sucks

That i made really close friends from Canada when travelling to Puerto Esconido for a month and that specific friend fucked me. And those around her. But this really broke me. in 2023, leading to prepare for 2024.

The McDonalds at the pioneer park

The performance for I did for myself and the soundcloud that disappeart.

A really really odd 2024.

I'm going to be a better man. I'm going to happier, cause I've posted my truths.

Preventing me to get food.
Comments being made by those when walking around the supermarket to get groceries to feed myself and heal. When this year has been terrible. This happened at multiple super markets. I had to resort to buying fresh vegetables and fruit from market stands that a lovely lady advised me to do. Probably the only friend I had some fun with in 2024.

I applied to 40 jobs and interview with 2. Ten tree in the hope to help them further save the trees, I aced the interview with TypeScript/Javascript. And had plenty of experience to get the job, after leading Shopify's whole Javascript front end team for 1 year, the largest TypeScript codebase in the world. I was shocked to not the job. The only other interview I
I reached out to my well respected investors of a startup they funded for me in 2023 and they had nothing to give me. One specific investor is angel investing in over 40 companies, another is the most respected CTO of the country and then another sold his company to Adobe. Not one gave me any proper friend advice on how to bounce back. None of them. This was my learning of getting investors that were actual people I had worked with and helped in the past. One I made the most respected VP of Eng for React/React Native but then that is what he decided to give me in return.

All the work I did for centre stage dance studio, all those in the Pitt Meadows, don't help. I asked a very close neighbour who I helped avoid a police incident, knowing his very clever, smart daughter could remove staples. And I asked him if she could come and do it with her mother privately to help my broken head made from a police officer. He refused happily and blanked me. So even my neighbours in Pitt Meadows, which I helped for 7 years run Halloween parties, Christmas parties, 

And they kicked me out and never, ever made me feel welcome when I returned to check on my children.

Honda CRV - don't ever fucking buy this car. The security systems don't work. On christmas eve, i went to a specific private spot to look at the mountains and for some reason my rear driver side tyre was deflated and led me to the side of the road to almost hit a pole. Fortunately my driving ability allowed me to swerve and avoid it but did smash the side of my car and no airbag was deployed and my head hit the steering wheel making me pass out on the side of the car. No one, checked on me, a crashed car on the side of the road, and about 15 cars passed and not one stopped to check. When my conconssion resided, I got back in the car, made the able to drive back home to survive Christmas this year. It's ok, the car itself is crap to me now, I used this car a lot, driving 50,000km in my research on forestry and wildlife.
This car has had so many issues, specifically the second key always being stolen. I had the first disappear from the first residence I stayed near Port Moody, it was a safe room that I booked. But fine, I went and got another replacement but then that key disappered too. The other odd ghost style things with this car, is that things would disappear from it. Like a head torch from my camping bag and then re-appear months later in the glove box. So, I believe someone has been able to access my car since purchasing it from an official car garage in Maple Ridge. This is now a company I do not trust, and will never associate myself with it. There's no other explanation I can give myself for the experiences I've had with this car since June 2024.

RBC desk refusing to give me details about my investment fund, and I don't know now if it even exists. It was joint account with my wife and then bank refused me access, when I had my driving license, my passport and they continued to say I don't have an account with them, when in the past I invested $10k in an investment for future growths, for my children. Shocked. At what banks are here in Canada.

2023
Puerto Escondido
Things I loved there, the local Ala Burger, one man and a grill and his wife cooking and delivering the food. I ate there all the time. One man, honestly that I would dream of flying to me to cook at a party, his burgers were off the hook. The other fancy places that had spotify playlists were shit, over priced, ponsy people in there and talking bullshit.

The only other place - was local market, - list out a bunch of great things. Like the fresh orange juice after my interval training on hot sands and tidal wave chi.

That one lady that I met there and spent a lot of time on the sunsets, went and got surgery on her wrist when at the same time I had some serious issues with my hand. It's just ironic. That at the same time my hand felt like it was being taken over when typing. Today that is not the case and I can now type correctly, it's probably cause she didn't give me a kiss. I decided to no longer talk to that lady as she didn't even want to watch a movie with me.

Trip to London - Saint Coffee shop - 

I took a couple of trips into London, but everyones was blank and dead. Just dead. They walked around London like zombies. Honestly felt like a different country from what I rememembered when I lived there in the past. One specific trip I took to the British Musuem. Every time I go, I always seem to spend time analyzing the greek gods and their statues, always wondering if they were all white men and women. But what do I know, I read what is published. So I headed down to the anthropology library at the bottom of the museum. It literally feels like you're in the basement. There I found some lovely rare gems. Books on astronomy, musicology and topics that aren't even being discussed in our society. All great learning if I'm able to have a country that supports me to work and deliver industry, engineering and science. Hoping it can still be Canada, as my children live here.

Bletchy park to be inspired by a great man Alan Turing that was casted out by his society around him. I wanted to soak him up in the office that he worked in to do what I believe was the most important work of 1900-2000 for computer science. Today his turing test is still the base principal in thinking of AI and other techniques that have not been developed to build machines, not intelligent computers that would try to mimic humans. Why would a man from the 1950s decide to make a test to ensure computers can never be humans. To me it's obvious, he was a very intelligent man and gay. And one that I would love to learn more on, just as a man and not his work that today seems to have been butchered.

One friend allowed me to stay at his lovely home in Whistler for a month when I was finding it difficult to find a home. Where I had a great time being able to re-connect with music. That family I do respect and hope in the future they allow to attend their parties, of which I have not been to one. Whistler itself is very un-sociable, I went out multiple nights and no one wanted to talk to me. So I stuck the forests and lake swims. There was a really good new york style pizza joint, but every day they didn't recognise me. No regular customer attitude at all here in Vancouver, BC, area. This behaviour I noticed all over my travels in Canada in 2023 and 2024.

Themes
- Lovely things that I did with whatever love turned up. Aria / Veer are my children.


Counselling 

Nightgale Counselling, multiple sessions and nothing. Didn't really understand any of the trauma that I was trying to share. It's terrible that there are private counselling firms in Vancouver that do this for $300 an hour. My own mind techniques, medidation and tai chi worked a hell of lot better, which also happened to be free.

The best individual I ever spoke to was a pyschologist that started to work with me and tell me about clarivoyancy, and whether I believe in the universe or god as as an anology for what is troubling me. At which I responded, none of that, but makes sense if others think that. For me, they are my memories and past trauma from being an orphan from a family that I do not want to ever discuss in my life of 44 years.

5 years old, she told me to stop.

Official - port moody, on the way up. Had to run away from Vancouver (I'll talk about why) and no check in, no phone call, no counselling anything. Just ignred. So lovely official mental health support.
Pyschologist - how he was talking to my wife behind my back.

UBC

Forestry BC email was good

The interviews I did with someone that worked at the BC parks.

Github gist to some art/celebs to build technology from the creative industry first than the capitalist. I reached to a specific group that run a podcast and no one from their team replied to me. So I posted what I've researched and developed for perhaps 5 years and not one took it seriously. Made me walk away concluding that the celebs are all dumb and have no idea on what they need to actually foster creativity and joy.

Odd things with online ordering, Amazon specifically that led to the cancellation of my VISA card with them cancelling orders, removing receipts that are no longer visible on my account. When logging in, I can't see my recent purchases, almost as though those purchases were transferred to another customer. I didn't reach out to them, as I believe the company to be evil if they are able to do things like this with their customers. The reports they made to the VISA led Simplii (CIBC) to call me and accuse me of being in Washington and stating that I had to reach out the credit bureau, which is all false. I refued and then they cancelled my card. Of which I don't care, ony that now I don't trust the CIBC and canada banking as much in 2025.
