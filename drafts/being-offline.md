As my previous post mentioned, I've been working remotely and offline a bunch, as I return to the world of online. I'm going to try and write up some of my findings on being offline.

First off data speeds are still an issue. Working with downloading software development packages on the go was hard. So make sure whatever you're working on has the compile pipeline set up before you head offline. Especially if it's a new project. I won't even bother to talk about embedded hardware programming, making sure you have specific parts has been a nightmare. But with data, you have to learn to be patient with uploading and downloading. I didn't go and buy a starlink or whatever, cause I didn't have time nor did I want to spend the money.

I burned up about 7gbs quite quickly in around 2 weeks. To better create offline separation, I connected another sim card, to also better manage data usage on the hotspot. But to be honest, for some reason, I burned up 5gb of that, in one work sitting. I think that was Spotify's fault, I think it offlined audio content. Or mac was downloading some update I didn't want. I kinda wish I could control network access per application on the mac. I used a raspberry PI to upload my drops of content that needed backing up for a while, purly because it was the simlest thing that can upload files. All I needed.

Entertainment. I purchased an [Anbernic RG35xx](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx) of these and it's been a lot of fun, killed a lot of time with some great classics that I wanted to play as a child but never got around too. [Little Sound DJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php) has been wonderful to make some sequence beats on the go. All on the same device, going to work on something that perhaps could maybe just upload my drops from a device like this. So the phone becomes just a gateway to connect to other computers.

I didn't take a kindle. I went to a 2nd hand book store and purchased 2 books. Ones where I started to read them a bit to see if I got hooked. A great thing about book shops, something we've lost when browsing books online. The main book I'm trying to get through is "", love the retro sci fi. Has probably influenced the perspectives I've been taking on technology and the world that I see.
Also been trying to get through snowcrash again on Audible, find it's narrated in a way that makes it fun to listen to.

- Spotify / Soundcloud - all require a subscription -> So anything I've been been paying for I don't own.
- Old iPod with my old mp3s that I ripped from CDs I owned before getting rid of them before moving to Canada.

Money of being online. I just want to point out something. That connecting to a wifi spot at a coffee shop is the easiest, but not possible when you're out somewhere remote or perhaps at an hour that the coffee shop is closed. So you'd have to purchase or have these things:
* Phone
*

You'd need this to even interact with locals, book an AirBnB. We lost the simplicity of a cheap radio being able to listen to updates. Perhaps we need to figure out local broadcasting of data steams.

Capturing thoughts on a digital device, I found myself always reaching for more.

Offline interaction -> Texts, people expect replies in a day. The same with DMs, context is always disconnected.
Lots of replies to my last post, of folks stating they're around for a chat, but the challenge with that is, the time is not in sync.

If I get time, and if someone replies to me to let me know, I'll share my thoughts on power. For more than a week, my main electric equipment (portable mic, phone, camera, op-1) were charged via a 10,000 mAH battery. To see how many times I ran out of power, what perhaps used up too much power.
