For the month of March 2022 (and maybe a little longer), I'm going to be opening up some of my time weekly to help those that might want some advice, engineering org scaling, individual mentorship, technology strategies (web or mobile), startup pitching, product market evaluation.

Why? I love giving and am in need of a good healthy dose of helping others. Also hoping to meet a number of interesting people.

Sold, and want in? Apply with this form. I have no idea how this is going to go, if I get flooded with requests I will have to update this post.

Notes for form:
* Type: Personal mentorship, strategy discussion, startup team

Here are some ideas, based on recent advising:
* Scoping technology trade offs, when to invest in what RnD
* Calibrating engineering individual contributor or management roles
* Navigating a personal journey in a startup, growth stage or larger corporation. Personal mentorship.
* Engineering culture, what makes a great team

How much is this going to cost? It's going to be free. If I'm going to be taking too much to help you or your team
