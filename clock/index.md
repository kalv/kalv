A different clock to help you meditate and concentrate on your work.

Think of this is an alternative clock you have on your desk that you can use while you're doing your work.

The concept is that the man created a sun dial to better plan their day, understand at what time they'd do a specific task. But in today's culture this leads to a number of stresses and work that you have to do outside of the task or work you're doing.

This ticks in what I call a 1, 5, 60. It still uses the concept of seconds but the time indicators are unique to your mind when it's running. So it becomes your personal clock.
