It uses [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) static site generator.

Also using esbuild to work with prototypes in Three.js, in branches that I'm working with lidar and voice to text applications. Allows for complex JS/TypeScript when required.

## Development

```
npm install
```

Or build and host locally for local development
```
npm run serve
```
Visit [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

To build the production build including JS minified and optimized:
```
npm run build
```
