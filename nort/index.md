<h2>Nort</h2>

A platform that I'm working on to scan any structure with lidar and upload to the web. Allowing others to see what you're seeing.
Would love to talk to Apple about this and work with them on what else they could do with this. I think it would be great for a new social platform for creatives of all ages and colours.

I believe being able to share immersive visual captures is the future for those that perhaps are impaired or un-able to get to a specific location. Such as hikes, monuments, impressive architectural or sites like Stone Hedge.

I'll next work on better lidar scanner, as mirrors don't work well, adding colours and sharper edge detection. It's great to use [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/), Apple have done a great job.

I called this Nort, cause I love Tron and it's spelt that backwards.

And I love that a VR model is rendered on my website again, since I had one using VRML when I first wrote a website for Anglia University for the first children that went online in the UK.
