<input id="box" value="" placeholder="SOMETHING TO SAY"></input>

My project this weekend. I made a young child erupt with laughter yesterday and I wanted to make something that might help young children communicate with something fun and words that make sounds. But making it accessible to all. So I constructed this tool to work on my website anytime anyone would want to use it.

Only works in the browser for now (updated on Nov 8th 2024).

Thanks to the lovely [SamJS](https://github.com/HeraldOD/sam) JS library, it is well written and well maintained.
