<input id="box" value="" placeholder="SOMETHING TO SAY"></input>

My project this weekend.

Those with listening difficulties listen a lot more than anyone else.

So I decided to use my 20+ years of science to build something to help kids and everyone else.

I think these people are probably scared, nervous or just never want to speak.

## Background of the idea

What I thought about over my coffee this morning?
Umm. You’ll only have your eyes. What makes having your eyes cool?
- Being able to see people having great enjoying experiences that they are a part of….
- Uh
- How would one with only eyes speak to someone on earth…
- Uh
- We need a button
Off I went to my paper and pen.

After my paper and pen:
Why hasn’t anyone built a damn type and speak out thing for a bloody website.
That anyone can open.

OK
