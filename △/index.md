<input id="box" value="" placeholder="SOMETHING TO SAY"></input>

My project this weekend.

Only works in the browser for now (updated on Nov 8th 2024).

To build a text to speech service in under 50kb. Thanks to the lovely [SamJS](https://github.com/HeraldOD/sam) library, well written and maintained, thanks.

I want this to be used by those with listening difficulties and children with learning challenges that want to communicate with others for free.
