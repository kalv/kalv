Text 2 Speech

Only works on desktop web browsers like Chrome, Safari and Edge. Not on Mobile. Sorry.

<input id="box" value="" placeholder="SOMETHING TO SAY"></input>

My project this weekend. I made a young child erupt with laughter yesterday and I wanted to make something that might help young children communicate with something fun and words that make sounds. But making it accessible to all. So I constructed this tool to work on my website anytime anyone would want to use it.

Thanks to the lovely [SamJS](https://github.com/HeraldOD/sam) JS library, it is well written and well maintained.
