Healing from a viscious RCMP attack on my innocently where they stole an O-Light torch and some Jaray Pro headphones. Leaving me at the Peace Arch Hospital bloody and made sure I didn't receive care for 7 hours. Not even cleaning my blood. A ranger checked on me in the back of the police car to say to the police officers "this is not haloween" and ran off.

it didn't break me though. I'm healing at my parents house in maidenhead. With a new torch I purchased from Amazon. P20707312. This time I will ensure no one steals it.
