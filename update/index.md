Healing from a viscious RCMP attack on my innocently where they stole an O-Light torch and some Jaray Pro headphones. Leaving me at the Peace Arch Hospital bloody and made sure I didn't receive care for 7 hours. Not even cleaning my blood. A ranger checked on me in the back of the police car to say to the police officers "this is not haloween" and ran off.
