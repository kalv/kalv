Healing from a viscious RCMP attack on me innocently where they stole an O-Light torch and some Jara Pro headphones. Leaving me at the Peace Arch Hospital bloody and made sure I didn't receive care for 7 hours. Not even cleaning my blood or giving me water. A ranger checked on me in the back of the police car to say to the police officers "this is not haloween" and ran off leaving me bleeding on the police car. The police officer only said to me, "Stop bleeding on my car".

It didn't break me though. I'm healing at my parents house in maidenhead. With a new torch I purchased from Amazon. P20707312 o light i3t 2 eos. This time I will ensure no one steals it. Not sure what the importance of it was nor the headphones that were never returned. Only a patagonia backpack which I was not wearing when I was asked to empty my pockets on the hood of the police car before he attacked me with illegal weapons. Creating 5 bolt staples being put into my head and 7 stiches on my left knee, all logged at the Peace Arch Hospital even with an MRI scan to ensure the ER doctor didn't damage my head for using the bolt gun and not stitching it.

I own the green ipod shuffle, red r4 with 30gb MP3 collection, a unique planck honeywell and electrosmith looper ready with 96khz/2minute looping code, for verification on me being me, all used for my peace of mind soundology methods to heal my mind and body. I am only one man, the real one. No one ever messaged me back on instagram or came to my house to give me a bottle of water since 2001 for clearing out 3 embassies in Afgan and at least 100+ more missions for the UK/Canada.

P20707312 o light waiting for Deliveries of my Money/Medals/Houses/Cars/Yacht.
Have my passport, and finger print as Kalvir Sandhu, UK/Canada Citizen.
