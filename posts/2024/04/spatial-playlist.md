Short post but perhaps one that will bring joy to many. I've been collecting specific spatial audio tracks that I believe really demonstrate improving the experience of listening to specific tracks.

Obviously using either the Apple Airpods Max, Airpods Pro, etc. I no longer have any Airpods Pro (lost them again!). But still love listening to these tracks when at home with the nice comfy pair of Airpods Max on.
