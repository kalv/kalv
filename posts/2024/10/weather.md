Sitting here in BC, with an atmospheric river over our heads and seeing the awful damage to BC properties here in North Vancouver, I've been interested to see what technology, applications are out there for data to better visualize what is happening in the world. So that people can better prepare.

So I sipped my coffee this month and got to work.

This is what I've found so far.

First off, there is a lof of lightning every day, almost 12-13k strikes, which amounts to about 3,808,800 Volts blasted into our earth every 24 hours. Don't believe me, [check out this site](http://www.blitzortung.org/) every day and look at the number increase in the corner. The lines on the map show which weather station validated the detection of ionization in the sky. I've been validating it for over 2 weeks.

There is a prettier version of this here [https://www.blitzortung.org/en/live_dynamic_maps3.php](https://www.blitzortung.org/en/live_dynamic_maps3.php) that shows the quandrants of how many lightning bolts hit an area for rolling counts.

Then there is one, that I've liked to use for live watching of strikes - [https://www.lightningmaps.org/](https://www.lightningmaps.org/).

Then it comes to temperature and accurate rainfall analysis, to see that in some areas of our world it seems we've been having 30-60mm an hour of rain! That's a new storm or type of categorization we'll need for that type of rainfall.

This is the fun dashboard i've found from a public weather station for Alberta Canada, nice to see the farmlands are healthy. [https://carstairs-weather.ca/pwsWD/](https://carstairs-weather.ca/pwsWD/).

[Live earthquake board](https://carstairs-weather.ca/pwsWD/earthquake_c_popup.php?script=earthquake_c_block.php&theme=user&lang=en-uk&units=metric) showing that even here in BC, there was an earthquake off the BC coast at 15:45 UTC on 22nd October 2024, [https://seismicportal.eu/eventdetails.html?unid=20241022_0000264](https://seismicportal.eu/eventdetails.html?unid=20241022_0000264). Even shows interesting things like areas that show repeated quakes that should be monitored.


What's funny in all of this, is that I think I saw a submarine on one of the screenshots, if it's still here on this webcam, it's probably a rock structure instead.
