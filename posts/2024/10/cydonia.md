I've been researching different imagery of Mars and excited to share that these circles seem to depict a great shape. And these shapes seem to connect with astronomy and greek methology in much more of a scientific explanation in how light and light would travel.

Here is my latest version of what I see is left on Mars for us to better understand. I like how the first large triangle depicts a lot of pyramid structures we have in our world, the earth. And there does seem to be a connection of some kind, one that I will find out in time. Looking forward to researching this further.
