I love my honda CRV, it's been great to use for the last 2 years. I wanted to quickly highlight some amazing advantages of the car.

First off, I've driven 50,000 KM on it, without a service and it still drives like a new car.

When I first drove this car, I knew immediately that it was a car. It moved off when accelerating like a mercedes, it had 50% torque front and rear engaged all the time, it was brilliant. Amazing for handling the road, when there is a lot of rain, which happens a lot here in Vancouver, BC.

It has amazing efficiency, I've been able to push a full tank for 800km. I think this is because of the method that I use to drive the car with low acceleration and move off to ensure good use of the hybrid battery and engine.

One thing that amazes me about this car, is that I think it has about 400 brake horse power. Have a look on the Honda CRV site and you'll see that the Hybrid has a 2.0L engine! Over the default 1.5L engine. And that HP is higher than the one stated for the 1.5L. And this hybrid has an electric motor that has 191 hp on top of the 2.0L engine? I knew this car drove well, but now I know why it has amazing torque and handling for the roads in BC.
