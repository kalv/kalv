Since childhood, I've been fascinated by what is left on other planets that might've had civilization before us. Even things like is Pluto a planet? Or a dwarf something? I think today it's a planet at the time of writing.

Most people in the world have been fascinated by a human face on Mars, or what looks like one. For me, it looks like a rock structure like a mountain. That could have photos taken with shadows to depict it, as the original shots of Mars from the 70s did. The new photos highlight it the same and for some reason always have a different shade or color of the Mars rock itself. Comparing that color from most photos to photos captured by the Mars Rover, you can clearly see the color difference. Of rocks that are quite dull and grey but in the pictures from ESA they are orange if not bronze.

This picture below is a sat photo of the region of Mars that contained the picture of the human face. Originally obtained from the ESA, which now seems to only have a picture of a smaller area.

The area below is one that I've been looking at a lot, because of the circles on it, they don't look like man mand circles. The size of them are too big, or must've taken people a very long time to make. These circles wouldn't of formed with water or other natural resources that Earth is aware of. So I left them as question marks. But when drawing lines they depict patterns, almost like star patterns similiar to work from the greeks.

Here is an overlay pattern on the picture of Mars to show some of the possibilities of structure on something we don't fully understand yet. Enjoy.
