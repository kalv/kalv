Things that computers can do to help the brain.

# The clock
Our clock is currently based on a 60 second tick and is predictable, so another person can sync with you to interrupt you for example. So they would look at the clock and know that at 2:45pm they are able to come and approach you. This is a bad thing for a mind to be worried about.

So I developed a stateful clock on my [website](/clock) which is called "A clock", the A symbolizes that it brings your mind down to the earth as a symbol not a letter. Then the tick is a tick. It's based on a random logic with a step of 1 second, then between 1-5, then between 1-60. And then will always display the two ticks. Watching and stamping it against written notes help just create a unique timestamp such that it is unique to you and you alone.

# The board
The next product that I've developed to demonstrate how computers help your mind, is my [board](/board). A tool that anyone can use to draw very quickly and save something, like a notepad. Making it work offline and on a website that loads in a bolt has been great to capture finger drawings when I've wanted.

# The text 2 speech
For those that are struggling to communicate with words to speech, I've developed my [Text 2 Speech](/â–³/) which allows anyone to quickly type and hear the words.
