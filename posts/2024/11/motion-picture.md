I've been working with AV1 image format for the images on my website and wanted to get it working for videos. Because on PNG images that are 650kb I can get them to 50kb, saving 90% of the data footprint.

Wanted to get it working for a motion picture. MP4 and even MPEG is lossy, there is no lossless video format that I can find.

The original clip is 44MB of PNG images (lossless), 204 frames. Each frame is 480x360 pixels.

My clip is 2.7Mb. Reducing it by 94%.

Could do a wind up movie avif file thing with the scroll pad on the play date.
