It took me by surprise seeing Zoe win an oscar the other night, mainly because she is from Dominican Republic. She is going to celebrate for the next year I'm sure. Zoe Salda√±a that played roles as a young lady as roles typed as ages between 28-32 year olds in movies like Marvel where as she's 47! What is she putting on her skin and what is her work out plan.

I'm going to outline some other actresses that you'd be surprised at their age and how great they look based on the roles they played in movies or TV shows.

Kristen Kreuk, looks just like she did in Smallville. If you were to look at her Instagram you'd see that she hasn't aged a day. It's probably because she's drinking the Gibson's water in her latest show Murder in a small town. When I was there, there is a sign stating that it's the best water in the world.And the restaurante Molly's has a lot of history. Her descent being Chinese and Dutch might have something to do with it, but what do I know about family ancestory and the importance of it.

Alicia Vikander plays a young uni student in Tomb Raider but is really 37. Amazing, probably because she trained at Royal Swedish Ballet School in dance when she was younger. Her role in Ex Machina blew me away.

Then there is Katheryn Winnick, who played an 18 year old throughout her role in the vikings and was beautiful throughout. She's 48 years old! And if you look at what is published on her feed, she looks the same. It could be that she holds a 3rd degrees black belt in Tae Kwon Do, a 2nd degrees black belt Karate and is a licensed body guard. A women that I'd want have around me if I was ever on a yacht.

Kate Beckinsale from Nottingham known for her movies Underworld who is aged 52 looks to me like she's mid 30s. What she does I have no idea.
