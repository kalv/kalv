I remember being in a library with a lovely lady in my past discussing different methods of planning long term strategy that would encompass years of different deliveries from different companies or departments within a large enterprise company.

At the time I came up with the concept of time unfolding, where you would have a diagram like below.

Basically you'd start with a straight line at the 'shipped' or the delivery date when all is delivered. The lines behind it are those that are planned with different teams or companies. So the yellow, blue, red and green would be commited to be delivered by others and have to be delivered at their set date. Think of the line at the bottom as calendar time, such that the yellow is shipped before the blue, etc.

Each line would have a date in which it would be delivered, this planning works really well if you don't do the following.

- One delivery per line, don't start to draw out trees of deliverables under the one line, otherwise that one company (say yellow) doesn't have control of their own delivery and are reliant on other commitments below, therefore breaks the time fold of 'shipped'
- If yellow doesn't ship on time, the whole time un-folding diagram would need to change again, such that all parties are in agreement for the 'shipped' date as this is a high stakes plan to emcompass a plan that takes months/years.
- Make sure to ship all the deliveries from the previous on purple. It would be insane of you're a leader and didn't decide to 'ship' all that was worked on for the defined date of the un-fold (in this case the date that would've been set on the 'shipped')
