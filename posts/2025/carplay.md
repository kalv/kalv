I've been using a lot of carplay and android auto whilst I drove around in 2023 investigating forests and environmental aspects of my work at the time. During which I observed a lot of improvements we could do to the system.

These are my wishes and ideas on what we could do with Carplay or Android Auto to improve the multimedia experience of using the system in the car but also how to use it for more than just music.

Being able to create notes but with the ability to navigates the notes and categorize them better whilst working with them. For example “Add to topic Electricity” or “Add this to tomorrow” or other voice based commands that should be analyzed during recording and the computer should do the action for you, not that you record one audio note and then later have to do work with it.

Being able to record some form of notes alongside the music being played in the car. I know that in the way the music is streamed to the car, that it is a one way audio stream with Bluetooth enabled and having the microphone enabled then stops the music. So I wish that it would be great to record notes on top of the music. So if a great track is being played, you’d want to narrate it and then have that clip shared with your friends or family later to share the joy you were having with the track and the recommendation. We used to do this with mix tapes, give a mix tape to someone that is curated, this would be even better as it would your comments on the music experience.

Being able to search for music should be more rich. Which album, what mood, what pick up do you need, what tempo, what style. Mainly because when you’re driving you can’t look things up and scroll for the favourite song. Perhaps people will want to sing the tune to suggest the song because most people don’t know the name of the artist or even the song.

The other wish is something that someone like OpenAI could release, which is having their ChatGPT assistant available with a button or SIRI command but I'm guessing they'll probably end up being closed down when Apple just release directly into their operating system, similiar to how the web browser was eaten by operating systems, like Windows (Internet Explorer) and Mac OS (Safari) to stiffle other competition. But we'll see.
