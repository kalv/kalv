Wildfires. Insane. Over the last couple of years, I've seen so many fires around BC/Alberta. And they are just growing and growing.

About 2 years ago, I designed a system of engineering and electronics that would affordable for all countries in the world and no one wanted to work with me.

I sent an email to the BC minister of forestry with a full google document outlining a number of concepts that we could use to reduce Wildfires in 2023. I had a silly repliy from the minister and was told that the document didn’t open. And that the work is already way.

So, I reached out to UBC with the same document and never got nothing back, other than being told that there is funding from Rogers to use their 5G networks, which I have no idea how 5G enabled phones with Instagram can help reduce the fires across our globe.

The designs I had, not only helped fire reduction but also model the terrain to see better data in realtime to ensure healthy soil irrigation and healthier crops. But it seems no one cares about farming.

It’s been a shame that I couldn’t get to do the work on this topic and see the forests burn over the last 2 years. And even today, now I read in the news the california fires are still going.

I worked with as many as I could but it seems that no one wants to work with me on it. So this is a topic of work that I'm no longer going to continue in 2025.
