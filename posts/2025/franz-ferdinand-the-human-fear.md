Listened to the new Franz Ferdinand album The Human Fear a lot over the last month.

Raw review notes.

1. Audacious

Lyrics are so smooth of the voice
The riff of guitar is classic Franz Ferdinand
Old school organ played in it is off the hook
"Stop stop feeling audacious, the unknown and the failing, they say just carry on" - "save us", great use of words to lift up the soul. "Ooon" ON.

2. Everdaydreamer

Bass kicking in at the start, wobbles the shoulders with the 'ah', 'ah' angel sound throughout the track, epic.
"No I'm fine, just need time for my mind to relax" - Great music lyrics
"Not in the room", for those that are alone in their bedroom working on important work. Great.
"What's the point of infinity". The synth sound of the choir effect, is brilliant.
"No this life is not over, until we know it's over", "the unknown" being ok with the fear of this and never planning towards it.
"I'm an every day dreamer" I can see any young child, women or man singing this on the way to school or work.
"Put a good dream down" - yes

3. Doctor

My favourite track on the album. All the lyrics make me laugh out loud.
"Nurses I can't talk to"
"I feeeeeeel a little better" - "I can feeeeeeel so much better".
"DOCTOR!" x 5 times or something - with the synth played in the back of it is amazing.
"Visions" and "nightmares", what is plaguing the minds of people, if they are, just listen to this track and bang out a dance with your body, shake it loose.
Listening to this song one wouldn't need to go the doctor.

4. Hooked

Phat beat, something that could be said that it was from the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s, 20s, 30s, hahaha.
It's a man song, a queen song, makes me feel like a queen man, yay.
Letting in the energy of Love. And letting a man feel their women self. Lada Gaga feel through it.
"I thought I knew what Love was" - uh you got me hooked, makes me smile.
Makes you just want to DANCE, when the hooked line comes in.
"That's alright" ater fear, encourages the listener to embrace ones fear and not let it take you over.

5. Built it up

Good slow down track after Hooked for the album progression.
Great use of a simple clap.
"Give me strength to overcome" - "Get some", "fix it up".
"Gotta Open up" - your soul, listening to your self.
Perfect after the previous track of meeting someone that got you hooked.
"Sound of each other hearts" - Hell yeah,
"Build up yeah" - with the guitar and progression of layers on their tracks.

6. Night or Day

Oh the piano. Honky tonk. Elton John would be proud to hear his style play on.
"Some days i'm here to just try" - Try, yep, we all wait for sun up and give the day a go again.
"Live a life with you", night or day. Encouraging men and women to have the one partner in the night and day, life. Love it.
"I'll never get bored of you"

7. Tell me I should stay

Seems like the song over coffee the morning after.
Church reverb effect on the piano would sing out across the kitchen.
Double Bass, low and moving the heart and chest.
The man would have to start dance around the kitchen at around 2mins in making the eggs. Holding something to mimick the microphone and sing out "Tell me I should stay here", "STAAAAAAY" - the guitar riff kicking in is spot on. Allowing time to dance between the next chorus and hope that she'll be in your arms.
Then remember to time the fresh brewed coffee to pour at 4:28mins in. To really get the brownie points.

8. Cats

"You love no one and everyone at the same time" say no more as to why this track is called Cats. "They can never turn". Is it women they are singing about or the pet cat. "Take it outside", make it be a cat and not a women.
"They never learn",  is a line that stands out to me about the women out there that like to think they are cats, kitties, very odd in the world of 2025. Spot on for an album called The Human Fear. Masterpiece.

9. Black eyelashes

Thought of Russian leg dance, Prisiadki, at the start or morrocon.
If you're playing this track with your women, hopefully she has black hair, LOL.
Women that are blonde might not like this track.

10. Bar Lonely

Back to rock influence.
"Bah bah bah" - to make you hum and just get into tune with the song.
"Hard to get out" - when you're busy at work, heading home from a hard days work.
"No one knows your name" - heading to your family, those that know your name.
"Follow" -> Is the word that stood out on first listening and 'neccessary evil' meaning to me to follow your heart at the end of the night. Meaning lonely is never lonely when you know your heart.
"Bah bah bah", and the piano banging out.
Lyrics are wonderful in this track.

11. The Birds

"Another ninja pigeon", "picking the crumbs" at "george square". Wonderful composition and lyric composition.
Great inspiration for the song, one would've thought that this track would've been about women, as 'birds' but really it's observing a stupid pigeon in say London.
The right place in the track at 1:30-ish to have the electric guitar sing like Jimi Hendrix.

|. Overall

Overall points
- The way he literally has ryhtym to his voice/lyrics in both the verses and the chorus makes the album weave through my mind and soul. Lifting it up.
- I appreciate the poetic nature of the music more than just the instruments and the drums. The way the layers of sound build throughout the tracks like their famous, Take me out started.
