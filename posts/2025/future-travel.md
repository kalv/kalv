The one country I’d love to spend all my traveling in. One country that no one would ever think of. Russia.

I think the people are hidden love and joy fanatics. I personally believe that they are stone when you first meet them, because they don’t trust you. Until you warm up with a couple of vodkas and then truly you’ll be partying with them all night/day/week/month/year. And they'll probably then adopt you as family.

The country is so large that truly the un-explored beauty is hidden and should remain hidden. The northern regions must have beautiful forestry, ocean beaches, coastlines, wildlife that I would love to capture with high quality photos for my private collection. Simply by carrying a camera like the Ricoh GR or Fuji X100 in my backpack and a water bottle.

As a single man, I just have a thing for the russian women I keep seeing on Instagram. It seems as though all of them are fit, sexy, slim and love food & dance.
