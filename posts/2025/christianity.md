This is a follow up on my post what god and religion to share my studies of the following. I want to share a little something I learnt during my upbringing as an orphan. I’ll share more in time on that topic, but I love my parents back home in Maidenhead, UK. They made me the man I am today.

So this post, is going to focus on Christainity. Like, why was it enforced around the world during 2000 years. Why were there people that went around the world to make them think of their god and how it can help them. In ways that were vicious, manipulative, capitalistic and wanted everyone to follow their god, instead of whoever was aiding ones family.

Another aspect of the religion is how many bibles are there? For me, I’ve seen so many books in churches that are hymns, adaptions of the original literature. This is mind blowing for me as you can still get the original texts from people of the past 2000+ years ago. Like the Anabasis and the Indica written by Arrian about Alexander the great, 336BC which you can pick up for $20 from oxford world’s classics which hasn’t been adapted.

One part of my life is quite tragic, I remember being a baby being thrown into a stone barn, why I was thrown there, I will never know. But through some counselling, and physcotherapy I remembered the experience and it has haunted me for the last year, in how could a mother throw a baby away to somewhere like that. I of course ended up elsewhere to be writing this.

After that, I had a number of tragic experiences at different orphanages, one specific one, I remember having to row the kids across Windermere lake.

During that difficult time of my life, I prayed, as I was told I was a child of christ. So once, I had a dad voice, tell me some really good advice, that I believed in and till 2023. I’ll never know the truth of where that voice came from, but it really helped me get to where I was in 2023. 

During my childhood I believed this was God, went to a church of england school and participated in a number of christain community events, such as lighting up the church for a christmas carol event. Gave a lot of my time for volunteering, ranging from reading to elders to handing out 300 cheeseburgers to homeless in Pioneer park xmas 2023. But really there is no church that associates themselves with this behaviour. And it does seem that each church is no longer an open church for all. So I stopped follwing christainity as a topic of education on how to be a good man. Today, I’ve studied many religons and believe just in myself.

For a time, I thought I was a christain. But hell no am I. There as a chapter of studying and practising Sikhism, but that wasn’t long.

The one aspect of following christainity and their people, was always a story about entering paradise, where it all smells of flowers and everyone is beautiful. But really, I think this was just a fantasy.

Led me to believe from others, real people that said real things about getting gifts for the work of god. This is false, they might’ve been given gifts or awards or money. But me, for all the work I’ve done in life for community, people, children and society. I have recieved nothing from a christain associated group.

Things that I heard through my life that led me to believe that I was someone special, or that there was a large important family waiting for me. But really that is just fantasy, that one is always looking for something better.
