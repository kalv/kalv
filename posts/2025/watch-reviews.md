Today I wanted to share a couple of watches I've owned over the years and what I liked about them and why. Leading to my favourite that I wear daily and why in 2025.

These are watches I've acquired over the years and each have a different meaning to me but also have different mechanisms. All are affordable and are not watches that are super expensive.

I no longer own this watch, but I built a watch using a kit from [DIY Watch Club](https://diywatch.club/), it was a diver style watch with one of those dials that allows you to move the ring to a specific marker. I found it fun to use this for swimming training rather than a timer based watch. Allowing you to not bother to keep looking at it.

I've always been a fan of automatic watches as it won't require a battery but found them to start to be heavy on the wrist and sometimes forget to wear it for a couple of days making it fall out of time.

In my pursuit of high quality automatic watches I found myself acquiring a Seiko Sports field series on sale and love it. The strap is my favourite part of it. The fabric was great on my wrist. It's an automatic that I would wear today if I was to wear one.

I've worn this a lot in hikes and love that it's small and automatic. The movement is silent and I still have no official details on what the red hand is that seems to move for days, like every 3 hour marker is a day. So it's nice for a weekend measure of time.

To replace the DIY watch club watch that I owned, I went searching for an automatic watch that had the same automatic movement. Found a cheap Bulova. It is a marine star and I love the fact that it has a rubber strap with dolpins on it.

I was always a fan of swatch watches but it seems their battery doesn't last that long and always needs to be replaced, but I wanted to find a watch that would have a battery that lasted a long time and was shocked to find out that Citizen watches have their technology called eco-drive. That allows the battery to be charged up from the SUN!

Of course, being on the cheap, I went searching and found a special edition, star wars rogue watch. This is my daily driver. I love that I don't have to worry about the battery. Being a massive fan of star wars, I love the design. Always making me feel like a rogue against the empire :)
