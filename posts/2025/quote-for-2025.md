This is quote that I've lived my life on and one that I respect the most.
It came from Bruce Lee, an old book that I've lost in my moves between Canada and the UK. But this screenshot is all I have.

The quote itself for me is that we can constantly grow, learn and adapt to our surrondings.

"The highest art is no art. The best form is no form." This one implies so much. What is art, is it a martial art, a method of creating work, a method to perfect ones body. Well if it is, then all of is never higher than you already know. So the best XXX is is no XXX. You'd have to think of the opposites of everything to understand one part of your thinking complexity to another.
