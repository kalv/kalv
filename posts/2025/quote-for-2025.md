`Fortune favors the bold` - Saw at the start of Alexander the great movie. `audentes Fortuna iuvat` originally in latin (somewhere 151BC). May of been a rewording of Democritus that `boldness is the beginning of action, but fortune controls how it end, `Τόλμα πρήξιος αρχή, τύχη δε τέλεος κυρίη`.

`Meal Shelter Water` - Kalvir Sandhu.
