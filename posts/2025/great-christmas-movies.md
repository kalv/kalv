My roundup of great christmas movies to watch with your loved ones. A lovely lady, your children and friends around a lovely warm fire.

Noelle - Anna Kendrick's performance is top notch. I can't believe that she can act with her whole body and that lovely face of hers. With a voice that is an angel.

Dr Seuss' The Grinch - Sherlock, Benedict Cumberbatch plays an amazing voice. You know it's him. Truly Cindy-Lou Who, you'll all fall in love with. The animation is top notch. And the dog, small that he is knows how to pull a sleigh.

Trading Places. Not exactly for the family and also not really a christmas movie. But one for the books. How a man from nothing can take down a very large money pit of a society in New York. Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd's performance is top class cigars.

Die Hard 2. Not the first one. But the one with the airport and how the planes need to land. When you hear the last song at the end of the movie, you'll know it's Christmas.

Scrooged. Now this is Christmas. Again not really for the kids. A classic tale of past, present and future ghosts that taint a very funny actor. Bill Murray is my all time favorite actor.
