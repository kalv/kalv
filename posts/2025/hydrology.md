What if it's possible to create small mini devices that follow this specification to help with monitoring the hydration of the lands to fight forest fires ahead of seasons. I call the concept Digital Bees.

A little box that can be thrown out of helicopters and fall through trees de-tangling an antenna cabling to use FM signalling to ping data to other point to point devices. Allowing for little pings of data such as temperature, irrigation and other variables to monitor large expanses of forestry. They could be powered with solar power and have low computing code written in C for ARM based processors such as the Electrosmith, allowing for simple compute for powerful data capture. Removing the need for 5g towers or high powered satellite weather sensory.

This can then allow us to better get early warnings of dry leaving, slow increases of temperatures or even lightning strikes for wildfires that could be contained around a central starting point faster than the fires that are raging our earth right now.
