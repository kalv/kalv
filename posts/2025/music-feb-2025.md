This isn't really a Feb 2025 highlight of music but the artists and music I've been listening to over the last year or so. These are my highlights, some old and some new for the month of Feb 2025.

First off it's [Ren](https://www.youtube.com/@RenMakesMusic), just watch and listen to all of him. I honestly think he’s a musical angel re-encarnated. All his tracks about the UK are on point, about people’s problems today and makes your heart lift up.
I first watched this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_nc1IVoMxc) and it blew me away, the lyrics, the music video, the ‘act’, almost like a theatre act. The performance is at the level of something to watch at the Royal Albert Hall.

[This performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDrFh9RnpQ4) is what he does for a friend that passed away, made me cry for hours, this musician is a composer, a true pure artist. At about 1min in, he celebrates h
is friends life amongst pure beauty. To fly and setup this and play this track amongst the mountains. Well done Ren. △

F Verve, [check out his rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwtEOp7pC1A).

Next up is Hania Rani, [this performance in Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5oZ80Daduc&t=390s) is just brilliant, the way she plays with her band is just mesmorizing.

[Tate McRae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5oZ80Daduc&t=390s), have to pick a sexy pop star, for me it’s going to be her. Her tracks and the use of studio stereo positioning in her tracks is bloody amazing. All her videos are entertaining, reminds me of early Madonna.

This is so not a Feb 2025 for me, but a band I haven't shared. Jungle, if you’re to watch one track, [watch this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ItKS8bUUTA). This track for me is their best, the one on one between a great white man dancing and then a black man. Then they just go in an old ballroom dance floor. You'll end up watching all their performances because all their music videos highlight great dance studios.

Ólafur Arnalds, and his [live Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMCiAKNUpTY) set, a beautiful setup and amazing surroundings to watch for the most peaceful performance of music. I've had this on in the background whilst working many times.

Most people probably know about Fred Again today, but I always return to his [Tiny desk performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQmPv_dTI0), he just plays and plays throughout the whole set. The way he uses all the instruments in the studio by himself shows that music just flows through him. All with cheap apple heaphones on :)

[Marc Rebillet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYJf_ybyVo), watching his performances, when it's just him in his bedroom is ace. He's the loop daddy, you'll know why when you see him perform.

[John Butler, Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYJf_ybyVo), I can't really say much about it, just watch it.

Daði Freyr, you might know them if you watched eurovision. [But this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK7dDgkQc40) is so not that. Just the bands performance, not a silly dance performance you might've seen them before in. The performance is stellar. All Live and brilliant, checkout the marker of 2min 20s, it's when he just lets loose and just goes. His customized Moog is just off the hook.
