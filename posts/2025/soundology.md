Similar to how an indigenous individual would create a fire in a tent with sage and other earth materials. The aromas would help the mind to focus on self and let it sleep, rest and heal in peace. I believe that each of us as the ability to focus our mind to heal self faster and slower depending on the stress and the thinking pattern we have.

After reading some literature in the british museum anthropology section of psychologists using methods in 1850s. I have healed myself both in the mind and in the body with the type of aroma in my room. These are the techniques I've used to focus on my work and body. To mainly heal an injury on my left knee from a violent RCMP attack.

- Using an op-1 to tune it's unique CPU frequency sound through a very old Aloe Vera I used to own in London from 2011. Bought for me from a greek friend. Having this constant in my room and then using the squeezed Aloe Vera juice into a smoothie allowed me to sleep in peace and rest my body. Healing muscle tension and tendons. Even healed a Kung Fu injury I had from Southampton University from 2001, that has plagued me my whole life.

- I have created a unique mind clock that I've been working on since Nov 2024, when I was plagued with un-focus, difficulty on working on complex tasks. Essentially creating a new editor for text to be able to read and let my brain focus, drawing tool, whiteboard/chalkboard for drawing out what I'm working on, why and when. The mind clock today uses the whole solar system planet positions.

- Aluminum capacitor pen, i've found using a Kickstarter project that created an amazing touchscreen pen that uses the capicitation of my skin through the whole pen to use my iPad. Using this I've found that even holding on one hand and in the other allowing me to breath better, has helped me relieve my asthma. Not requiring my inhaler.

- I have applied this research to growing tomatoes and amazing cherries in my parents garden. Applying a unique sound structure with tempo tuned to my own soul. Then performing mui-chi (a new form of tai chi to music), similar to what people called rain dances back in the day, or tribal dances around a fire for a great harvest. Has led to amazing produce in my mother's garden. Raspberries, Strawberries and even very sweet figs.
