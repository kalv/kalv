Searching for oneself. You have a lot of time to reflect and think. For this post, what Religon?

As most men, you hit a point of a downturn in your life. For me, I've had a number of experiences, almost starting from when I went to an even in Vancouver to celebrate 10 years of Launch Academy or something. It was held at the D7 bar in Vancouver. I had a lot of things to say about the people there but it's just interested that for me, that is where things changed for me.

During that time, I've looked to identify myself and who I'd follow for inspiration, in the past when I was child I turned to the bible, god and church. But today it's dead. I went on 2 trips to the church and both time, there was only 4 or 5 people. So didn't learn anything or get anything inspiring from it for my life.

The most I learnt about myself was when on trips in Puerto Escondido, looking at the crashing waves, every morning on sun up, sun down and the beautiful stars that came out. There's one horse constellation that I've loved since 6 years old. One that has always kept me going.

With this in mind, I searched for literature on those that are guided in life with the waves (ocean), sun, and stars. Pre greek, because they didn't use sand or the waves (ocean). Those that worshipped and believed in the sun, were aztec and all their practises and following is gone. I gave up on understanding how budhusiam helps anything other than having those people just walk around not caring. The indians have many named dieties (gods) which is really confusing, they should just workship their own father and mother.

One honery mention I'd make in my travels and research, is Japan. They at a time really respect the heroes of the past, in that they would have a shogun or man that was respected in their prayer rituals. This all I learnt on a trip to Mount Koya (高野山, Kōyasan) and the blissful temples. There I practised being a monk for days, eating vegetarian food, that we had to cook in front of us. It was hilarious, we'd practise form all day and then sit starving with no food since 6am. Then handed a pot, water, vegetables and oil. I had no idea what to do when first doing it, then realized it was up to us each individually to boil the water and then cook the food in front of ourselves. It would be a very sore wait, but the ritual of itself in 2007 showed people of today, that food needs love and time vs fast take out from McDonalds.

For a time in my research, I liked to think I was an oceanian, but then I remembered about my childhood fantasy. Alexander the Great.

A man that accomplished so much, with all forms of leadership, war and blood if need be. But his love for setting up cities, people aspects after every safe he did. He gained love and respect until he died.

Anyone can pick up a copy of the indica book and learn all they like about the man. It's a $20 oxford press.

As a reminder, these are stories about his greatness from -300 years (meaning the year is 2324 if I was to run a Macedonian calendar).

He was a Macedonian, so today going forward in 2025, I'm going to think of myself as this type of men, further learn and practise on what made them great. I left the church when I was a child after my experience in Maidenhead and the school Altwood, being a Church of England school. Then never practised anything Pubjabi that my family did, I didn't get the practise of giving all the time and never getting anything from the people around you, the community that it forms seems to be very self centred and only on one family, their family. Similiar to the Blueberry farms you see around Vancouver area, that have a massive mansion on it.

The part, I'm a little rusty is my navy skills. Looking forward to getting out on the water in the future.
