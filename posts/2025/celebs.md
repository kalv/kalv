Last year, I spent a long time seeking investment. And it seems that I was only able to get some early angel funding from some canadians. And after that period of time, I upgraded my designs and research and continued to reach out to others that would potentially help me.

But when I wanted to build a new video/audio streaming service with a new protocol that allows video and audio to be transmitted at a much faster speed and lower bandwidth. Such that countries like Mexico would benefit from video interaction at local villages for the school children.

But it seems that no one reached out, I'm unsure why no one wants to build anything great. But for record and if any celeb wants to see it, here is the link to the post I shared with the folks at Smartless, and they rejected it, or copied it. Not sure. Don't care.

Just know that trying to build technology with arts and creative industry, won't work. It seems that they are spending their money on something else.
