As I've been travelling I've been pondering on how best we could best cultivate the deserts, getting trees to grow back in Sand. There is a lot more to work on with what I'm sharing, such as research with a team and many lab based experiments.

The theory works on the basis of cold air, dew in the morning and capturing the condensation earlier to let it sit between two materials. What if it's possible to grow a moss like substance on the sand, one that perhaps takes a couple of seasons rater than expect seed germination in days or weeks.

I once saw Ice still formed on sand in temperatures of 10-15C and specifically on dead wood. Decomposing wood, this decomposing wood would've had fungi that could have either electrical or energy properties. These properties would therefore create life, in ice like temperatures. The reversal and understanding of this process would allow us to better grow a moss on sand.

I'm exciting abouted perusing this in the future such that we can bring back green to the areas of yellow we have in the world.
