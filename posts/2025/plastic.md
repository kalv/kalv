Theory of Plastic re-cycling

To China, I’d love to work with your country to create a plastic re-cycling center.

To de-compose Plastic into it’s base chemical structure. Similar to how Oxygen is broken out of water with a fractional distillation condenser.

I started my research to think on how to break the bonds similar to how Bromine breaks a carbon-carbon double bond, Electrophilic addition.

Polyethylene Terephtalate. Essentially is a bonded C10H8O4.

What power and energy would be required to break out the carbons and oxygen, or extract the oxygen similar to water leaving only the carbon. Allowing for the carbon to be used in other material construction.

I have many thoughts and designs to explore to test to ensure this process can work simply with a yacht pulling it out of our oceans. The process would even create clean oxygen for the environment like trees. Cleaning the oceans for the lovely whales we have.
