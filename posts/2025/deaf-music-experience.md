I've been constantly wondering about those that are impaired, and how they would enjoy the great music available. I've been constantly listening to the lovely Taylor Swift Lavender Haze and been designing an app that can create a new experience for those to enjoy the track.

First they would obviously hold a device of some kind. To me this has been an iPhone pro, that would be in front of them in their hand.

The track starts with a booming bass/synth line that can be translated into a haptic vibration sound pattern that could provide the sensation of the music to transfer to the body. As a bee buzz.

Then the lyrics of the track could fade in or scroll in innovative methods. For me, I'd like these to sway in the direction of a movement pattern to encourage the individual to move. As they would move, the accelerometer can then show the individual the next movement, dance move. Even an arrow of some kind, music artists could then influence the pattern they'd like the individual to dance to.

If an Apple watch was worn, the BPM of the individual could be factored in adapt the haptic or even another vibration effect on their wrist to encourage the Joy of the track.

I'd love to get the time to work on this prototype with music artists, and believe this would open up a world of Joy to those that can't listen to the music from great artists.
