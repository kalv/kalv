Theory on ensuring our seeds grow the best produce they can. Seeds can get healthier when kept over seasons, ensuring that the seeds will grow the best it can on the soil and environmental conditions of the land. Getting new seeds from another land area and growing them on your land would obviously might not germinate or grow the best crops as your own seeds.

Not exactly farming but related in getting more from a specific food. To better extract carbohydrates from oats, let them soak overnight in water. To ensure you’re getting more potassium from the oats, use them in your smoothies in the same way after soaked. Cooking them and then soaking them also releases more stuff, that I havent actually been able to measure with a proper chemistry set. But for me has allowed me to reduce my weight by 60 pounds. And really with one of those smoothies it powers me for the whole day. The ingredients I put inside that smoothie include a banana some Chia seeds, honey, Icelandic yoghurt so it has a higher probiotic count and some cocoa if I’m feeling like something fun.

Healthier soil should be reviewed more than just the sand and clay compositions. It would be great to see diagrams and designs of soil including the evolution and growth of the microbes, such as Bacteria, archaea and fungi. How much of this makes up great soil, what do we do to increase say just the archaea. As I walked a number of BC parks it was interesting to see rare areas of decomposition of existing forestry, letting funghi and other forms of healthy regeneration occur. Then there is the water flow on the soil, when there are no healthy tree roots to keep the soil together, water will flow through it all washing away anything, leaving sandy/silt based soil.
