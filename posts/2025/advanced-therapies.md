Musicology for healing. here are some approaches you can use on top of Yoga or Tai chi to better heal your body and mind.

- Use a beat making device like the PO-33, record your own sound sample from your mouth’
- Create a tempo or sounds that makes it sound nice
- Adjust the BPM to match the speed in which you’re working with your stretches or body movements
- Ensure you have good headphones that stay in your body
- Tap parts of your bones in the area that you are trying to heal with the composition playing

Think of this is as a modern approach to those that did this dancing around a fire. In 1850s there was a german scientist (don’t have access to the reference, was a book at the british anthropology section at the british museum), who used music in sessions to heal those with serious mental and physical trauma. For me it was shocking that this was written in 1850 but yet not persued as an approach to heal people over pharmacutucals.
