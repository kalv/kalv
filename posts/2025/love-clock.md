What if people can't keep to time. What if they can't meet a specific location at a set time to collaborate, be together, for life's work.

I started to wonder about a clock that is unique to a family and returned to concepts such as the water clock from 300BC that invented the 24 hour clock hand. What was the original, the sun dial.

The sun dial has an original concept of being unique to a person a set location. I have developed one for my Apple watch and iPhone that uniquely works for my location in Maidenhead, Berkshire, UK. This means that anyone wanting to meet me would use the same time and need to be in the same location. I look forward to developing this out when I meet my future partner and working on a family clock. Such that we could say, let's meet together for dinner at "113.68" and it being only that time at a set location as the acurrate GPS of today gives the sun clock Azimuth exactly for a location. If an individual is driving home from work they could see the time change as their location worked towards the exact Lat/Lng.
