Since arriving to Canada in 2011. Not only had my body health deterioattied. But my bloody teeth. My wife at the time was always insistent that I had health, clean teeth. But for some reason, today in 2025, they are terrible.

The last procedure I got from a very well known dentist in Maple Ridge, told me to bleach my front tooth to whiten it. But for some reason last year in 2024, when practising my martial arts and new forms of water chi, when my tongue touched the front of it, my head always wanted to arch back.

Since then, I've been able to stop it, but it's really odd, so I'm no longer going to trust any Canadian dentist.

The other aspect that has been crazy, is that when I smoke a cigarette, my tongue seems to move to other teeth. I have since tuned that out of my head as perhaps a wierd random question thing in my head. 

The science in this that is interested to me, is that teeth are connected to how our skull and mind is connected. If you ever feel this when you smoke or have your head arch backwards.

This is what you do:

1. Get a coin
2. Get a magnet, a small on it
3. Put it your mouth, smoke or do your yoga

Do this a number of times and your brain, spine and skull will be fine.
