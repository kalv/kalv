I've travelled a lot through the United Kingdom and want to highlight some of my experiences and the amazing things I saw.

These are the best places you should visit.

The first place you should visit is the British Museum. I could spend a week here. There is so much to see, read and learn about the world. Specifically the library in the cellar. It’s the richest anthropology section of books in the world that I’ve found. When I was last there, I got to read books on innovative health treatments that were carried out by those in 1850 that aren’t being worked on today. Concepts like musicology in the african tribes used to heal those in their community. Astronomy and how it’s used to stabalize mind safety and other concept that are over my head.

Natural history museum - Every time I visit London with my children, I take them here. There is so much to see, ranging from crystals/rocks, fossils, rare animals and the ability to see the size of a full size blue whale, if it’s still there :)

The only museum I’d mention is an art museum, the Tate modern. The large open space when you enter always has amazing art installations from people around the world. Multiple floors with a beautiful tea room that overlooks London. The stores are amazing here also, I’ve always picked up unique art prints and posters.

Bletchly park. The one musuem that will make you think for sure. Literally the best musuem to learn not just about the hard working people that helped us defeat the germans but the history of the war and how we should never ever want that again. Excerpts from those that had hardships in factories, ground tactics and the journey they had to crack the enigma code allowing us to defeat the U-boats. Then the priceless exhibition area with an apology from Gordon Brown for Turing because he was cast out for being gay.

If you go to one pub to see an old pub, go to the George Inn, made in 1676 and was mentioned in the Charles Dickens novel Little Dorrit. If you’re tall, be careful the ceiling isn’t that high and it’s hilarious that you can see it slant in that it’s very old.

Now on to food markets. There’s literally one for this too. The London Borough Market, the best food market in London. So many foods, stalls and fresh bakeries from around London. Monmouth coffee was first there and then grew to covent gardens, make sure to grab a brew. Fish as a resturant has always given me the best fish dishes. Black & Blue in the same market area has brilliant cuts of steak.

For other coffee brews, and best espresso. Make sure to check out Nude espresso if you find on your maps as you travel around. Don’t bother with the costa, starbucks and other chains.

The one place I’d recommend to have a drink, would be Gordon’s wine bar, est 1890. It’s quite popular so expect to wait for entrance, but when you’re in, you’ll be able to drink wine in the oldest wine cellars of London. They literally have barrels of wine ready to pour out.

For a dance and club, the one place I’d recommend is 93 feet east. 7 days a week, always a DJ, Band and great music, great vibes and an eclectic mix of people. You can even see who’s playing live on their [website](https://www.93feeteast.co.uk/).

I’m not much of a shopper, but here’s a couple of places worth noting.
Denmark street, which has the leading music stores, guitars and others all on one street.
Hamleys which beats the toy store from Home Alone 2 with Trump in it.
If you have the money, check out Savile Row for a tailored suit.
For the men, Taylor of Old Bond Street, aromatherapy for hair and skin, it’s on the sign of the store.

Now on to the countryside.

First, the Cotswolds, this is the best place to go see the countryside, the lovely cottages and gardens that the people look after in the area. Lovely bed and breakfasts with lovely locals, tasty pub food and great scenery.

If you like your flowers, gardens and great architecture buildings, make sure to check the [national trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) for their conservation work in any area you are living in. And when you’re in london, don’t miss a visit to the [Royal Botanic Gardens](https://www.kew.org/).

Cumbria, loose yourself at lake windermere and all the ice cream you can eat. Make sure to try kendal mint cake, the one substance you’d eat on long hikes. If you do decide to walk up a hill (or mountain if you want to call it that), make sure to take a rock from the bottom and place it at the top.

If you’re feeling ambitious and want to see unique rock formations on the south coast, head to the https://jurassiccoast.org/, park up at one of the spots and then walk along the coast. And stop at a pub for a somerset local beer.

Now for the best drive you’d have in your life. Head up to isle of skye. You’ll need to make stops and stay at other locations on the way if you’re heading from London. When you’re there, you’ll release the epicness of the island. I’d want to stay there the rest of my life if I had a choice. Checkout the Talisker tour if you want to check out one whiskey distillery.
