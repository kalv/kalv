There's so much talk to colonize and build a civilization on Mars.

There are minerals, there is technology that allows us to go there, there is water there that we don't really know how to extract. But would cost a lot of money and time to do it. Why is this more important that feeding the people of the world, or providing 'clean' water to the 2 billion people (as stated with the WHO in 2021) on earth today. Isn't that more important?

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hMCs3b8I0m8 this dude talks about it. Mr BBC physics, I always forget his name.

Elon Musk and Nasa are talking about it a lot. Probably just for rare minerals that could be very valuable to earth. That's all I can think of as being the real reason.

Don't we have enough space on earth already? If I open up google maps, it shows a lot of land on Earth that doesn't have civilizations living there. So why would we want to do that.

I'm a no one, just writing these silly blog posts. To me, I think I'd rather concentrate on the 2 billion people that don't have clean water.
