I don't normally do this on my blog. But this is a movie review.

Probably the best movie I've watched in 3 years. [Road House 2024](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3359350), it was recommended from my dad. And damn it's good. The acting is on point, it's violent but realistic in how the police would act in a society of evil and dispair.

Jake Gyllenhaal is a bad ass, solid stone throughout the movie with ethics to never kill anyone, I might be giving things away, but I won't go into detail about it.

It's a modern cowboy story of a man coming to a town of evil and cleaning it up or does he, you'll have to watch it to see what happens.

The acting from Conor McGregor (yep that UFC fighter) is actually bad ass too, he is probably the best villian I've seen in a movie.

The setting of it being in florida keys and ensuring a rare bar stays open playing live music is a great setting for what would be a modern town in a western.

The fighting scenes are realistic in that the men are not all just super men and the women even stand up to the men. Something that is rare to see in movies.

I'll warn that this movie is not one to watch with the kids. It's an adult movie.
