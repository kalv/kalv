Sharing some notes I have on mental health services in Canada. Private and those provided by MSP. Both really were quite disappointing and let me down.

I've used a number of services over the last 2 years dealing with the amount of trauma that I've had in my childhood that surfaced over the last year or so. Then the breakup with my family and loosing my kids.

I first started with a pyschologist in Maple Ridge, which ended up with him wanting to keep prescribing me drugs, then discussing my private matters with my wife because she was a family friend. Outragious and something that ended up having me not trust him. It was insane, as this pyschologist was one of the best in that area of BC. I continued to take the medication that was prescribed which helped calm me for my days of work.

After that, I turned to counselling such that I could better discuss the areas of my past that I wanted to resolve. I went to a firm called Nightingale Counselling in Vancouver. It was a lovely man that I warmed up to, but then found myself just sharing a lot to him and never him really giving me much to use. My last session with him, I found myself telling him my methods to deal with the areas that I was working through. He didn't really understand any of the trauma that I was trying to share. It's terrible that there are private counselling firms in Vancouver that do this for $300 an hour. But for me, I learnt my lesson. 

My own mind techniques, medidation and tai chi worked a hell of lot better, which also happened to be free.                                                  
The best individual I ever spoke to was a pyschologist/counseller when I was in Puerto Escondido. I had calls with her in Toronto. It started to work with me, but then she started to tell me about clarivoyancy, universe, stars and some other concepts that sounded too far fetched. It did educate me on the topics that others are thinking through when they think fast and have a lot of thoughts pass through their own head. I found the hypnotherapy method work really well to go through some of my memories and past trauma from being an orphan from a family that I do not want to ever discuss in my life of 44 years.  But helped me come to peace with it all.
 
One session got really close to something that happened to me when I was 5 years old, but then she told me to stop. Which confused me and I stopped to work with her, as I really wanted to uncover that. I ended up doing this myself in Puerto Escondio (MX) on a number of activities to work through my mind.                                                                                              
Upon returning to Vancouver early 2024, I decided to visit the local Fraser Health services as I had no one to talk to, and was feeling alone with what I had going on in my life. It was a great service and found myself giving updates on my progress towards my job interviews, but after they all rejected me. I ended up not visiting them anymore. They had said they would check in if I missed a visit, and I did find myself in the Okanagan, missing an appointment and was shocked that no check in or follow up call was made. I feel this was a failing of the BC service, in that they didn't deliver on what they said they would. Either way, I was fine where I was, enjoying the horses and animals on a farm that I was staying at.

I'll leave the post with one thing, in that you own your own mind and can medidate and work through all problems if you stay determined and focussed on your goals. The comment of day by day, is false, you have to just go and go and not stop.
