Since my last post about music in [March](/posts/2025/music-march/), I've been getting back into the joy of albums.

1 Giant Leap 2001 - Probably my favourite album of all time. Made from some of the best music artists, even a track from Robbie Williams and Maxii Jazz, with one of the best raps I've ever heard to lift up my soul with JOY. Samples and sounds from Africa and the world. Reminding me of festivals like [WOMAD](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=womad&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&channel=31). The track Ma' Africa, has such an amazing sound scape that if it was played with Apple Spatial sound, it will blow people's minds. The beats that come in at around 1:40min feel like I'm channeling the energy of all the tribes of Africa dancing around lovely fires, evening meals as family.

Avcii TIM 2019, after discovering Avcii's amazing podcast episodes, I went searching for his albums. And OMG, all tracks are excellent. Especially Heaven.

Daft Punk - Discovery. One of my all time favourites, Bigger Stronger and Digital Love. If you get a chance, watch the full [Interstella 5555](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8&list=PLTT7zbo_Fv8olwazusz7kbZyDf5Oj6FNz) all great animation song videos.

Linkin Park - Re-animation. This band is perhaps one of the most underated bands, the compositions of these tracks are from an artistry on par with beethoven, mixing wonderful sound scape orchestration with what is the sound of Linkin Park and their unique rapping/rock style.

Taylor Swift - Midnights, mainly because of Lavender Haze, I could loop the start of the first 10 seconds of this track for infinity. All the other tracks play well back to back.

Sigrid - How to Let Go. A new artist I literally discovered last week and found this album so on point with the today of 2025. Bloody amazing. Tracks like Mirrors and Burning Bridges. One album I'm going to love listening to with my daughter. She and me will dance like no one is watching to this one. All of her music videos are excellent, [this what they did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohnbvNWYkk) blew my mind. Trust me, it will not be what you expect.
