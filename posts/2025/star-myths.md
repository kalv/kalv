I’ve been interested in astronomy since childhood and it seems I’ve heard a lot of myths on what stars can do for humanity, friend discussions and debates. From my reading and knowledge, here is what I think in 2025.

I’ve heard that some folks think that stars talk to you and can share knowledge. This is ridicoulus, what voice is coming from a star that is billions of light years away, how would that sun/star be able to talk to ones mind from a dot. Not possible.

Which then leads me to some that think they can hold their hand to the sky and call stars. Like the Osiris hand that some use, in that they use the three fingers to align with stars. Even if you do, it wouldn’t do anything, again some topic as no one there to talk to. I’m not sure what the Eygptians used any of these methods for, but today, it seems we’ve been watching too many science fiction movies.

The theory of Constellations was that they can be used to focus one’s mind in that they are associated with their human identity. Which is why it morphed into the horoscopes and symbols that connected with the year/month you were born in. But I’m sure they meant a lot more for those 3000 years ago, but that would be knowledge we’ve lost and not know what to do with it.

Aztec and other regional developments have building structures that show they have knowledge of the sun cycle and moon cycle. San Juan Teotihuacán for example has chambers around the main Sun tower that show the stages of a moon cycle, probably rooms used for meditation, healing or other aspects in what the power of the sun and the moon can provide.

They don’t give you energy, you only give yourself that. Some think that aligning their soul with a number of stars that their body will be stronger, you’ll get more confidence or other skills. This only comes from you, your peers and family.
