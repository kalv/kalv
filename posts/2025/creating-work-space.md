I've struggled to create a space to work in silence and not have conflicting thoughts on the progress of complex designs and implementations in computer science.

In the past a number of methods have worked such as:
- Specific background music
- The right setup in the office, chair, monitor, objects in the room
- Time management

Today I use Deltos. Which is found with the link above, use your eyes to find it.

Music resonation that is random and unique, helps calm the mind. The dots and lines helps create a unique visualization that removes the distractions in the brain. Having your notes un-ordered in time, makes you use your eyes and brain to think about what you've written and why. Focussing on a visualization of a photo themes your mind with a window, like the original idea of wallpaper pictures for computers such as Apple and Microsoft.
