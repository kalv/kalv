I've struggled to create a space to work in silence and not have conflicting thoughts on the progress of complex designs and implementations in computer science.

In the past a number of methods have worked such as:
- Specific background music
- The right setup in the office, chair, monitor, objects in the room
- Time management

Today I use [Deltos](/deltos), a private one page operating system that creates a unique sound sequence to calm and focus the mind. I have yet to publish it.

Music resonation that is random and unique, helps calm the mind. On Deltos there are dots and lines to help create a unique visualization that removes the distractions in the brain. I have your notes un-ordered in time, making you use your eyes and brain to think about what you've written and when. Focussing on a visualization of a photo themes your mind with a window image, like the original idea of wallpaper pictures for computers such as Apple and Microsoft.
