What if aliens don't invade with actual space ships but could infect our minds. Perhaps I've been watching too many science fiction movies but a theory can be just that. So i'm sharing a little about something I've been thinking on. 

We've heard of stories that we can hear voices from the land, our ancestors or other 'signs' our eyes would see once or twice in our life. What if it's possible for another mind to intefer with that. If that is the case, then it would be possible for another mind to talk to ours on this planet through technology we'd not have an idea about. What they'd use that for, would obviously be malicious because they wouldn't tell us as human would shake our hand physically.

Technology such as being able to use our Sun as a method to connect via very long distances and their stars. If that were possible their vessels wouldn't even need to be in our solar system, they would sit outside it and use our planet as they see fit. They'd perhaps even mimick stars that aren't even real to those they might talk to, to make them believe they are friends.

Perhaps they wouldn't even want to invade, they might just want to witness what they could, from the minds they'd connect with. Perhaps they'd want to use our minds for creativity or unique new solutions that they'd then learn about more on how we could work for them. I have so many theories on what a group of minds would want from those that are cleverer than the calling mind (or hivemind).

Either way these are some options I've worked on if it were possible:
- Shielding ones brain, take a look at my article on modern dream catchers.
- Loop yourself, literally your voice and play it over some headphones if you're troubled with thoughts that don't make sense, almost like evil intentions.
- Magnets, magnetic formations around ones mind allows us humans to 'sync' with the core of our earth, ensuring we are one with it. Even wearing an automatic watch movement device on your wrist will help. Always.
- Set up a triangle of coins with magnets on it around a space that you can think clearly in. Similiar to what wicca would describe as a protected space, concepts like salt or other forms of ground ones mind wouldn't work with what they would use with the sun.
- This one might sound a little bizzare, but leading a pure/righteous life, as you'd have more pure sunshine being able to hit your body. Like a beatiful flower.
- Self ionizing water. Water would be one last medium that helps a mind ground themselves. But to those that would use the Sun as a method to pentrate a mind, the water wouldn't be enough. This could be as simple as dipping a 9V battery into some water before drinking it.
- If you're body has trouble moving, you trip a lot, or your feet feel misaligned if you train Tai Chi, then it could be your muscle and nervous system is misaligned. To better train here, use a BPM/music sync. Take out a PO-33 or similar device and set the BPM to the same as your heart rate and then train against that music. Think of this is a modern 432hz Budda bell frequency that others have meditated with.
