I've been busy cleaning up my blog and I've had time on my hands whilst deciding what role to work on next in my computer science career. So I've shipped some products to my blog to demonstrate the possible future with Technology with certain companies, mainly Apple and how web can enable a number of applications or upgrades to the content we serve to everyone in the world.

# Just Share App
A tool I made a number of years ago to demonstrate the power of P2P even for today's applications. It works without the need to upload files to a server. Using my distributed computer science knowledge from Southampton University. 

You can pick a file, any file, a text file, an image or a video file and seed it right from your browser and then give the 'Magnet URI' to another and they enter it on the same site, that they can load up and download the seeded file. So simply go and [Just Share](/just-share)

# Vlog App
If you need to make a video that is small to share on Just Share that is local and private and a file, You can use this [Vlog app](/vlog).

This was built to demonstrate the oppourtinity of client side encoding rather than server side and how it will save on bandwidth of uploading high quality recorded video and taking a long time. It uses all in browser C compiled WASM to reduce the file size and quality to a version that is good enough to share the video with others.

# Nort App

[Nort](/nort) is a prototype for an application for what is possible for a Social platform for Apple and their use of Lidar. I made a prototype client application to record a scene and then upload it to my site, this could easily be the next Instagram in how creatives could scan different scenes and make immersive experiences for others. Perhaps even for Vision OS.

# Board

I wanted to draw interesting creative shapes with multiple fingers and earlier test what the possibilities were with Canvas drawing on the web. So I created this [Board](/board) app, it's a lot of fun on the iPad.

# Text to Speech

There's been a lot of investment and work with large language models to make text to speech models in getting a voice to speak out words. But I remember earlier days of a commodore 64 having this feature with very limited computer resources. Using speech synthesis. I went ahead and researched this area and worked on a prototype. It earlier used SamJS and now uses the native speech synthesis engine which I was amazed to find out is supported in all web browsers. I've gone ahead and used the same code to read out any article across my whole site. A feature that the BBC or Guardian could implement.

I love that this this [Text to speech](/t2v) is available on this web site such that anyone can visit this page and type in some text to speak it out, without having to fiddle with operating system hidden options and settings.
