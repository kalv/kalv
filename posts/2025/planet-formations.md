Sharing my notes on a theory on how planets are formed. This is a topic that I will continue to research and ponder throughout my life. Nor do I know that this is all true, but like to believe that these aspects that I'll cover will be great to dig into and further develop with funding.

I posit a couple of things on how planets are formed around the sun.

When we think of gravity being the force that pulled rocks together, it makes me question what types of rocks were pulled together to form a complex planet such as Earth. The concept of larger mass objects coming together and forming a cluster of some kind works for me in the mind for asteroids rather than planets. Our planet (earth) is a living rock, the molten rock core rotates and moves in the centre of the earth. If it's moving, it could said that it's alive. If it was to stop, it would die. It's power and continued rotations would be powered by the sun.

For this complex earth core to be built by the universe, how was it possible. Why were certain materials pulled together, or other materials that led to the formation of the oceans, the land, soil and other aspects that led to the creation of bacteria, fungi and in time life. It has to be more than just gravity and objects smashing together after the said "big bang" theory.

I believe that there a number of other forces at work (No not aliens forming planets). Specifically these variables of physics that we could model and better understand. Ones that I'm excited to learn more on in the future.

- Magnetism, how much did magnetism play in the moving of materials together to form specific structures.

- Sound. Space is a vacuum but does sound travel through materials, rocks? It does, so what would happen if a sound signature is one rock compared to another. Do they attract or detract. Would they need to be different frequencies. Are these sounds we don't know about? 

- Earth has the Van Allen belt (two radiation belts trapping charged particles) around earth. How was it formed, why did it form? Were these created by the sun to help contain what was required to form Earth?

- Proton analysis â–³, as a flower gets sunshine to allow it to grow, what were the protons that came from the sun to the planet and why. How can we better understand healthy sunshine even just for our bodies. Then be able to take the concept further and understand what it would it do to materials that were being fused together at the creation of the planet.
