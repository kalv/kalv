Found this wonderful old logo of the BBC and would love to see it be back on their website. Specifically the slogan of "Nation shall speak peace unto nation".

And I love the pole that the top lion is holding, that looks like broadcast for all on the planet. 

The knight helment that any women or man could wear to ensure the nation speaks peace.

The color is a beautiful aqua blue, like rare coast lines around the world that have this due to sentiments depositing along beaches.

Then there is the two eagles, the condors, protecting those that would be working to speak peace.
