If I had a time machine. I would go to these people to share a coffee and enjoy their thoughts and conversation.

This used to be a question I'd ask any lady I'd meet to see what they'd see. Most people would say, I'd rob a bank or freeze time to get more time on something they'd want. Me, I'd want to enjoy the company of these people. Even if it was for 5 minutes.

I'd assume that a machine would be limited to a number of trips, so to travel 7 times in the past.

Never in the future as it's un-written from what I know today on April 8th 2025.

[John Lennon](https://www.johnlennon.com), for his love and joy he expressed in his music. I would just want to play the piano with him.

[Diana Spencer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Diana-princess-of-Wales) - for her giving to the children in Africa and her battle against the awareness of AIDS.

[Avcii](https://avicii.com) - The Swedish producer and DJ. You can travel back in time yourself, by listening to his podcast which is still available on [Apple Music](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/avicii-fm/id445221220&ved=2ahUKEwiBuZqNwceMAxUpWkEAHT-wKC0QFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2DC9SY53Hg3u1ErDmN6o7l), probably the best music mixes available in history. I'll be travelling to Stockholm when I get a chance to see their [Avcii Experience](https://aviciiexperience.com).

[Jeff Buckley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Buckley). I would sit at the back of his Live at the Sine performance in New York. Probably crying with joy. A man that plays the guitar like a Harp from Heaven. A voice that encapsulates all the angels in heaven. If you get his album of the recordings, the first track [Be your husband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYukHsAsBxY) is a masterpiece. He even plays a Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan track, knowing the Hindi lyrics.

Nikola Tesla. A man that is literally forgotten today. Get his [book written by W. Bernard Carlson](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tesla-Inventor-Electrical-Bernard-Carlson/dp/0691165610/ref=asc_df_0691165610?mcid=b9dbb8fdbd3938909e581c5a0adb776a&th=1&psc=1&tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=697250157571&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15219228783192516920&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006906&hvtargid=pla-434008853426&psc=1&gad_source=1). His work is still un-finished in the methods he was exploring for reciprical power sources and we today just look to oil and batteries. This photo of him, inspires me daily.

<small>How he constructed a device next to his ability to read and think in peace.</small>

[Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill). British Statesman. Soldier. Writer. Literally to smoke a cigar with him. I'm very sure that he would not say a word. A literal roaring lion.

[Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan) to hunt with them in Teotichan and then party with the Sun and Moon. There's no link I can share that truly encapsulates who and where.
