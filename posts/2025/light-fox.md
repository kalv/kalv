There is a region of mars, called Cydonia that has had people interested for a long time stating that there is a human face rock structure.

For me this region is far more interesting in that there are these large circles that I have no idea what formed them. They are clearly not meteor craters and for sure requires further study and analysis to better understand visually from pictures and satellites rather than any on surface mining or exploration. What do they depict? Were they made by others Billions if not a number we can't define years ago, when Mars was perhaps a different surface. It's fascinating to wonder on this.

One triangle is clearly matched up, I've drawn these lines to show it. That triangle does seem to have matching angles. There are many more smaller cicles or dots which could make up different patterns.
