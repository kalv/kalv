Remembering Last.fm, or should I say Audioscrobbler. It was a great service that I used in the mid 2000s for new music suggestions.

It originally ran as a winamp plugin. Winamp was software used to play MP3 music files that you'd pulled off a CD. It would then submit the ID3 tags (name of artist, album) to a service that then ran a collaborative filtering algorithm against what others had listened to. Which would dleiver you suggestions on what you'd also like to listen to.

Today there doesnâ€™t seem to be much innovation in the space of music like this. Mainly because it seems monopolized. You can really only listen to music on Apple Music, Google and Spotify. You can't buy albums as MP3 to own anymore, which I hate. If i choose to stop paying for my subscription to Spotify, I loose the music I've loved to listen to over the years, this is crap.

We have collaborative playlists in Spotify and Apple Music, but this doesn't allow us to discover new music from those you don't know.

On Last.fm, you would discover new people that listened to the similiar tastes of music, irrelevant of whether they were your friend or not.

It would be great if Songza or other listening services would do this. Only such that you'd discover artists that would make you dance with joy.

Radio doesn't do this, it's always trying to stay fresh with new tracks and are on a track rotation. The playlists seem to be the same if you listen to the radio for more than an hour. Some radio broadcasters play 1/2 hour sets on a theme of music, like DJs on Radio 6, Strombo on Apple music loves his music and selects the best artists/tracks for his shows.

This year, I'll be on the search for the best new music services.
