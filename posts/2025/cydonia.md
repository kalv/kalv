It's the weekend. And I'm ready to publish this and share this with the world and want to work with many other scientists on what this means for Life on Earth. Specifically how we can protect it.

Fascinating odd Circles on Mars. Most people are obsessed with the human face that is pictured in Cydonia. For me it's the fact that these perfectly formed circles line up making triangles. What do these triangles depict. Are they lessons from a race a very long time ago when perhaps Mars was the Earth, what species, what were they trying to leave as lessons because really Mars is gone and today we have Planet Earth.

For me, I think it's a reminder of the importance of Triangle logic and core Life practice. One aspect for me in history that I've read and obsessed about for 2000+ years is Meal, Shelter and Water. All life species including us Humans, eat food, drink water and create shelter. As animals, birds are the best example, when creating nests as their home, bears sleeping in caves or wherever they do, because we wouldn't want to know ∆.

There was a time when I believed that throughout my life, it was driven by Joy and Love, but really today in 2025. This has been very difficult to continue, mainly due to the way the world has treated me. No Joy and Love has ever been reciprocated to me for the work I have done in many fields, for many people, for many countries. Really Life to me today and in my research/journalling over the last 5 to 6 months, is Doing and Moving. Such like a baby, they cry to communicate a message, which I'd say is moving their throat, kicking and squirming which is moving for themselves. Even their internal organs move to consume their food, lungs to consume their oxygen, and then power their movements.
