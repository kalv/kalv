Perhaps plot lines for future science fiction movies, but these circles on Cydonia fascinately create triangles, and from my knowledge on Geology are too perfect to be a natural formation. This observation can help us better understand the importance of learning by seeing and wanting to work with others that see what is being questioned.

Look forward to discussing this with like minded people that are interested to look to the future than stay in the past obsessing with what looked like a human face. Did someone see a human face in the Sun billions of years ago vs what they looked like on Mars and start to worship it?
