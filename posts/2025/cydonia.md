Like what the hell? I woke up this morning and reviewed some imagery of Mars. Fantasising about whether there is extra terrestrial life out there in the universe. And remembered that there was a human face on Mars in a region called Cydonia that I investigated when I was publishing articles on MySpace in the early days of the web. Today reviewing this, I found that there are more interesting artifacts on the region. That there are these perfect round circles on the surface.

What are they? Why are some exactly the same size, why do they line up in triangles, what do the triangles mean and was the human face just a distration that we'e been made to look at as the public. What if the real map of some kind is the circles and what does it mean?

For me, I believe it's a method to allow us to figure out a way to open a discussion channel with those out there but would need to understand star light and what a gateway of the mind would be in a triangle. The one triangle of human practise that has been around for ages, would the 1. Meal (feed), 2. Water (drink), 3. Shelter (Home). These 3 elements being practised since humans first settled. These being triangles, do they have something to do with why we wonder about the pyramids and other old structures that depict triangles but in the last 1500 years we've obsessed with complex structures and principles that we run our life with.

I've drawn some of these out and am sharing it, excited to explore this further with people of the world.
