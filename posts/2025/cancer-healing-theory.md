I believe that there is a theory that connects cells to sound. Cells can vibrate as we do with most exercising and gym work so theoretically cells could vibrate in a way that could heal themselves. 

We would just need to know what type of frequencies to send to it and whether it be happy, enjoy music that lifts one soul similar to an effect when you see a live act performance, where your hair stands on end.

The other aspect to correlate this theory is the cold dips and hot baths you can have. Like the Scandinavians, who would do therapies such as cold dips and then in the hot baths and rotating it. Such that it shocks your body and as it shocks your body, it shocks the sounds to regenerate and heal your body.

Roman baths and other old Greek mythology shows that people during that time did the same thing. You can visit Bath in the UK to see some of their old Roman baths and see the different chambers of the dead rotate the people through natural mineral waters from natural hot springs would obviously do the same.
