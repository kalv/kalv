Sharing my concept of [Nort](/nort) as a great platform that can exist for social creators.

I've been investigating the potential of Lidar and how devices have had these scanners installed in them for over 4 years. And really the 'measure' app is still the only app that most people have on their phone but don't really know about.

I see Nort becoming a platform that can scan any structure with lidar and upload it to the web. Allowing others to see what you're seeing.

Would love to talk to Apple about this and work with them on what else they could do with this for their Vision OS. I think it would be great for a new social platform for creatives of all ages and colours.

I believe it will be able to share immersive visual captures for those that perhaps are impaired or un-able to get to a specific locations. Such as hikes, monuments, impressive architectural or sites like Stonehenge.

The prototype I have is simple for now, but highlights what is possible. It's just me in my bedroom where I've been working on my simple macbook air. 

I called this Nort, cause I love Tron and it's spelt that backwards.

And I love that this VR model is rendered on my website again, I had one using [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) in 1996, when I first wrote a website for Anglia University with the first children that went online in the UK.
