Sharing my concept of [Nort](/nort) as a great platform that can exist for social creators.

I've been investigating the potential of Lidar and how devices have had these scanners installed in them for over 4 years. And really the 'measure' app is still the only app that most people have on their phone but don't really know about.

I see Nort becoming a platform that can scan any structure with lidar and upload it to the web. Allowing others to see what you're seeing. A product and service that will revolutionize the world, better than instagram.

Would love to talk to investors one day, Apple or Google about this and work with them on what else they could do with this for a social platform. I think it would be great for a new social platform for creatives of all ages and colours around the world.

I believe it will be able to share immersive visual captures for those that perhaps are impaired or un-able to get to a specific locations. Such as hikes to a rare hot spring, monuments like in the british musuem or impressive architectural or sites like Stone Hedge.

The prototype I have is simple for now, but highlights what is possible. It's just me in my bedroom where I've been working on my simple macbook air since arriving to the UK the end of Jan 2025. 

I called this Nort, because I love Tron.

I love that this is a VR model rendered on my website again, I had one using [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) in 1994, when I first wrote a website for Anglia University when the first children in the whole of the UK went online and appeared in the maidenhead advertiser as a kid genius.
