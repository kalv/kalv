Clean water theory.

I just posted some thoughts about why we shouldn't care about going to Mars but it made me stop as I started to think about the 2 billion people that are without clean water. The devices we could manufacturer and provide to them would be super cheap, if we were to design them that way. For people in countries like Africa.


First off there are carbon filters that can be constructed with a simple bottle and burnt wood.
There's a great guide outlining it [here](https://www.drinking-water.co/filter/how-to/make-charcoal-filter/#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20make%20a,another%20layer%20of%20polyester%20fiber.)

But then there is the bacteria and other micro organisms that are bad for us. To clean that out, we'd have to invest in constructing something that is accesible to all.

We'd need a portable UV water purifier. It would need to work with a hand based power source. 

Something like a hand crank light but with an UV light, it'll be as simple as that. Something that would cost around £10 for the recycable power, but would need a UV light source. A UV LED arould only consume 6 watts at 5 volts, so wouldn't require much.

You can buy a [simple hand UV light sterilizer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sterilizer-Portable-Ultraviolet-Sanitizer-Disinfection/dp/B08XPGHG9F) for £29.99, so it's feasible that the device above could be constructed and supplied to a number of people that don't have access to electricity as easy as us in the western world.
