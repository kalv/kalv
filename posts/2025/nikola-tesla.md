If you read the Nikola Tesla book called "Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age", you’d see that he was attempting to send higher amounts of power of the radio waves or even through the earth (which isn’t a great idea but still he experimented with a lot for his time of early 1900s). Specifically there was one aspect in which he was struggling with multi phase frequencies of electricity. Today we have DC and AC, but what about today if we were to use CPUs or compute to better be able to split and work with different frequencies of electricity that could be filtered out into clean energy.

The question I posit is whether we can today attempt his same experiments with modern technology such as what we do with microwaves or other technologies applied to theories of old. It might reveal that we could perhaps generate higher amounts of electricity with an alternator in a car or something.
