The vitruvian man, a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci has always fascinated me. Last year I noticed the symetrical lines at the bottom of the drawing and took a stab at trying to understand what he would've meant with these markers.

He was a very clever man when it came to the drawings and this specific drawing has a lot of detail, so these lines were there for a reason for this man in 1490.

My theory is that he was trying to leave clues to someone else to see something that was to be investigated more from his discoveries. For me I see them as line pointers to specific parts of the body that he was investigating. You can see the lines that I've made that are straight for these parts.

This second picture I took a stab at thinking at what he might've meant for the mind's eye as the lines do match toes and the chest. Is there a pattern between your mind, the chest (how you breath) and your toes? I don't know, but I love that a diagram from a scientist in 1490 still opens up more questions on what was known or what was still being worked on.
