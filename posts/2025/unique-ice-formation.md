I was out for a hike on Valentines day in 2024 on my own and enjoying a great trail I went out a lot in 2023/2024 for exercise. The trail is Golden Ears in BC.

As I was walking along I noticed a small ice patch, upon looking closer, it showed this amazing ice formation between sand particles. Makes me wonder what type of energy there is in ICE rather than FIRE.
