For the last 2 years I've been working on a better video and image processing library. That would allow faster image and video delivery. Ideally being able to deliver video in 1080p on a very small bandwidth connection.

To do this, I've had to research and read through all the multimedia original codecs, image libraries, video encoding approaches. Build different applications to work with these media and determine a new algorithm that will work for these goals.

I've started to call this Bolt Video and at the moment it's going to be open source as I don't work for anyone.

My goal at the moment is to have a music video being able to shown on this blog.
