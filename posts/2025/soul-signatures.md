I'm sharing some theories on what makes a soul and a mind. Concepts like this can help you find yourself but also your soul mate or other aspects of right friends and your community. This is a theory I’ve been developing for a number of years. When I first put it together I became scared in what people might be able to do with the theory. I’ll explain later.

Today most think that your soul or mind is measurable by a number of questions such as, what did you study, where were you brought up, what are your believes that drives your purpose in life, what are you morals and ethics. Or stupid things like what are your followers on Instagram and what posts T do you share, what type of person do you portray. Today we could consider a lot more than this.

Dancing is a good field to look at. There are a number of stories where people meet on the dancefloor as they would move with one another. Tai chi hands is another practise that could be used between two people to see if they are similar as the practise involves having to read one another for the pairing of the chi flow.

My theory today is that there are a number of variables or factors we could look at to better understand what makes up a soul. I should mention that a soul in this article could be just considered as your mind and body. The pursuit of being one with yourself. But after that, who are similar to you.

I mentioned tai chi above. Once you’ve mastered the ability to better understand the flow of energy in your body and blood flow, you’ll be able to better understand new emotions and feelings in your body when working with another person.  This could be extended to better understand what things around you in the world makes you feel that way. For some it could be just the ocean sea water or specific practises like even perhaps hiking peacefully on a long hike. We each have different triggers of feelings and emotions.

I don’t have much equipment to test this out, but I’m sure our brains emit brain signals that we don’t detect, similar to our body releasing pheromones that attract and detract others around us. These could be measured in time to add to the variables above that make up an identity of a mind/body.

Music. There is a lot more to sound and how it makes us feel. First I’ll mention how buddhists use certain frequency of sounds for meditation and cantering themselves. There are playlists that are specific BPM that are used in the gym training or cycle gym work. What happens if a playlist is created that is customized to your now. Meaning that it would know what mood you’re in and play the right music, lyrics and other aspects. You might’ve felt this at a great concert, when your hair on the back of your neck stand up. This could indicate what types of composition of music triggers your soul and lifts it up. This can then lead to those around you that feel the same with the music and mood.

The danger of this theory, is that as we learn more about what makes a man or women, it could lead to those that would use this theory maliciously and potentially possess people, prevent those that have genius abilities or use this knowledge against them for paranoia, or other sabotage reasons for a human. I believe and trust humanity that we won’t.

I’m excited about a new dating service that could take advantage of this theory and maybe make a better dating mobile app than swipe right and left :)
