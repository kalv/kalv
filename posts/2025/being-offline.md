Sharing notes, concepts of working offline and online with potential opportunity to better work in peace.

I've found myself working offline, without cell tower connectivity and even WIFI routers, as I found the incoming notifications to be a distraction. Also the urge to always look something up vs just sitting and thinking on the problem in front of me.

I first found myself doing this with a thinkpad x-250 I owned as a simple machine to investigate the use of simple computing. And using it with Arch Linux CLI installation only.

An opportunity here for AI services, would be to have a queue of questions for an assistant of sorts, such that when you're online, the questions would fire to the service and answers would be retrieved. I find myself always parking a number of questions to further investigate later rather than in the instant. Whether for programming, design or science research.

With multimedia creations such as photography, video or even music studio creations. I'd love to have them queued and not connected to the social network instantly, never live instantly. Why would would music creators or even any creators want instant feedback or critique. They would want to have it later. So a concept of a buffer would be excellent. Allowing creators to have their media all buffered and ready to upload when they are next online. All web/API services today have this setup such that you are connected to the internet.

Apple could utilize the concept of their Apple Accelerate framework and on-device encoding to ensure the video/audio is transcoded and ready for upload the moment an individual is oline.

Power management is not an issue, as modern computers like the Apple macbook air m2 has plenty of power. In puerto escodido, mexico, i used a power bank to extend the power of the machine by easily another 8-10 hours.

Offline media content is a breeze with applications like Apple TV allowing you to offline great shows like the Silo and Slow Horses.
