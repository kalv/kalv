Let's all remember remember november 5th 2025. Guy Fawkes, look him up. Why did he want to blow up parliament? What did the UK government at the time do to him and his people.

Movie recommendations for you all, that I think you'll truly enjoy.

V for Vendetta - Just a man with some great speech of words in V at the opening and Natalie Portman with an interesting accent.

End of Days - A bit of a lost movie, one that I truly think has a lot of true messages about a potential end of the world.

Daybreakers - A vampire movie that will truly make you think about what a world being ran by vampires would be and what their problem would be. Hint, they run out of life to eat.

The day the earth stood still, the one with Keanu Reeves. Literally the world is all evil and react very un-kindly to first contact and then pays the price.

1977, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Just watch it.
