You won't believe this. But these actors were in Neighbors and some weren't what they look like today in Hollywood. Almost like they were normal people.

First off, Margo Robbie, yes. Her from Barbie and the wolf of wall street. Check out her acting in this clip.

Russell Crowe from Gladiator and a number of other movies played a man with an amazing hair cut.

One more to make three. You won't believe it, before he was Thor it was Chris Hemsworth in what I see is working in a car stereo store. And with no buff muscles, looks quite skinny really.
