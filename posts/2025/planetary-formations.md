The theory of planetary formation

Needs further research and development when I first wrote it in November/December 2023.
Formations does not include electricity/ionization of rocks.
rocks are land / trees(life)
Needs Light - Protons, are protons formed on 3s?
Magnetism of non-metallic objects, the attraction of two materials.
New my theory is that there is Sound that needs to be considered in the attraction of two materials, as a form of resonance above what most have experimented on till today being ions/electrons.
Then what forms the van Allen belt, which is what we think is ionized, is it sound based? And sits higher than the magnetosphere?
So Saturns rings ring (Sound), the moon gravitational pull works with the oceans (rock), which makes lovely sounds, like Tofino, BC and then light, the spark of which the sun blazes the sky.

So the formations of materials on our planet based on even the molten core can be sound. The core makes sounds, earthquakes and volcanos do. The movement of materials within the rock.
e=mc2 -> I think Einstein meant mass x complexity (many other variables that we are un-aware of) to form safe re-producable power one day. But it all stems from the Sun. △ 
Really, this concept can/could/maybe lead to new forms of electricity generation or concepts of power from safe/natural resources that are renewable and rotational (meaning one use of a material being looped back into another of another material).
But the investigation of sound and how it works with rocks, sand, water is where I’m very interested  in at the moment. Something to ponder on my travels.
