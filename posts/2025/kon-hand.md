I have been researching how we interact with computers today in 2025 and went back to the original thinking on what function a user would be doing and why do we need a mouse. For the impaired.

I love what can be done with modern Vision ML that is ready to go in all machines, specifically Apple today, I am using it research what is possible to have the ability to control the computer with your finger and gestures instead of a mouse.

I call it Kon Hand.

This would be great for musicians not wanting to walk over to the computer as a completely new UI peripheral that we haven't seen since the introduction of the xerox mouse in the 1970s.

This combined with Voice, would mean you might not need a keyboard, for those that have difficulty with their fingers.
