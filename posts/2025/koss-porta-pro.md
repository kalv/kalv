These are the best headphones anyone can own. They are the best sounding for the price but really, any headphones I've ever owned. Comfy. Light. Full of sound.

I originally used a pair when I was 12 with a sony cassette walkman player. The yellow sony one.

First off, I love how they are called 'On-Ear' and not over ear headphones. The original designers were experts in Sound.

The set I purchased are red hot.

They were first introduced in 1984 and the design is exactly the same. The sound is off the charts, it's sound is wide, great bass, mids and highs. Full range of all frequencies on just a simple headphone jack (my macbook air m2) and the lightning dac jack on my iPhone Pro 13.

I can't state enough how comfortable they are, it is the way they have the pads positioned, just above the ear and a simple metal band that fit my large head. The light switch that reduces the pressure against the ears allows them to feel like they are invisible on the head and great for women and children.

If you need then to be fasionable, there are many colours stocked. I'm looking forward to becoming a collector of them in time, I want to own the green ones next.

I'm Not that interested in the wireless or other versions of them, as I know that the original design is built with a high quality stereo 3.5mm headphone jack.

Their old ads in the 80s are so great, here a couple that I pulled from their [official website history page](https://koss.com/pages/koss-history). Head over to their history page to see all of them, they'll make you smile and laugh :)
