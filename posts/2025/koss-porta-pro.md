My HiFiMAN Sundara headphones, which are planar magnetic no longer work well and I don't have my headphone dac and amplifier to use them like I used to when working at Shopify. So I've been looking for the best over ear headphones that are affordable (under 40 pounds) and sound just as great on any headphone jack.

I think I've found the pair, and funnily enough it's the same pair I used when I think I was 12 with a cassette walkman player. The yellow sony one, can't remember the exact model.

First off, I love how they are called 'On-Ear' and not over ear headphones. Probably what the original designers of great headphones preferred to say in their labs.

The set I purchased was from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005I49784) and are red hot.

They were first introduced in 1984 and the design is exactly the same. The sound is off the hook, it is wide range of all frequencies on just a simple headphone jack (my macbook air m2).

I can't state enough how comfortable they are, must be the way they have the pads positioned, just above the ear and a simple metal band that fit my large head. The light switch that reduces the pressure against the ears allows them to feel like they are invisible on the head.

If you need to be fasionable, there are many colours stocked on Amazon or other retail stores. I'm looking forward to becoming a collector of them in time, want to own the green ones next.

Not that interested in the wireless or other versions of them, as I believe that the original design uses a peice of copper or some other material in them that make them very special.

Their old ads in the 80s are so great, here a couple that I pulled from their [official website history page](https://koss.com/pages/koss-history) which I don't think they'd mind. Head over to their history page to see all of them, they'll make you smile and laugh.
