I've always had it on my bucket list to see the northern lights. I was very lucky to find myself in the oldest BC park north of Whistler. There I found a lovely spot to camp and was blown away at what I saw in the sky at around 11:45pm. At which I found myself staring until the early morning hours.

I found that it healed my attack from the RCMP officer and felt amazing in the morning. One thing that I found so amazing about this experience is what I learnt about myself and how much love I can bring to the world. I felt so happy when driving back alone listening to Tate McRae, I'm ok.

The spot I liked the most seeing the lights, was where I parked my car and found myself wrapped in my old duvet on the front window shield of the car. It was unblievably peaceful with no voices in my head driving the feeling of being unsafe from my attack from the police officer earlier in 2024.
