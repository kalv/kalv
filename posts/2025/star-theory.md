Star theory. In my travels, and work to improve myself. I've been studying different methods of finding peace in my mind and body. I started to read about constellations and the use of planetery bodies in how they can help meditate and heal ones body when you work out.

One aspect stood out to me, and that is how the stars form letters and that words would relate to the starting of these letters. Here are my findings and what I believe to be the best words that a Man, Women or Child can practise in their lives, for the most positive impact to themselves in the lifetime.

The principle being that the Sun gives life and that when a child is born, their life is given. They then have their whole lifetime to work with the Sun. Not just a day.

These would be acts a single individual perform over their lifetime, not a single day. And acts that a group would never perform. Just a single individual.

These words have to be crystal clear that an individual can only demonstrate these as a word that doesn't have a pre-context word.

Another way to look at these is what do we people, see is absent from society today.

`A` Answer - To give truthful answers 
`B` Build - Working constructively on personal growth, relationships, or community projects
`C` Create - Bringing positive things into the world, whether it's art, solutions, or a supportive environment
`D` Defend - Standing up for what is right and protecting those who are vulnerable
`E` Edify - To improve someone morally or intellectually. The underlying metaphor of "edify" comes from the Latin word "aedificare," meaning "to build."
`F` Focus - One that focuses on their work during the day/night. To get the best focus, I find calming and relaxing the body and mind to help.
`G` Good - Just go and do the good work to those around you. If you practise religon, it is a fundamental theological statement and appears throughout religious texts and literature influenced by faith. God is Good.
`H` Home - Ensuring one has a safe home and gives a home for others. Tribes would insist on giving up their home to travellers, a meal and water always.
`I` Self - A single line would emphasize the importance of any human finding their inner self, being one person.
`J` Just - The most difficult letter, there is not much in history with all languages but I order them this way. One must be Just. 
`K` Kind - To be kind to those around you always
`L` Tick (Yes) - This is not saying the word 'yes' but the act of completion of a good task. Seen in the stars, this is never a 90 degrees letter, it's a tick. A correct, complete.
`M` Work - Self explanatory. Work is here under M as it's seen in mirror when seen in the stars. 
`N` Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs, so a NO would be yes/yes with a given time (as O is a concept of Time). Imagine in your minds eye, joining L and L without the 90 degrees angle.
`O` Obey - For those with the light in their soul, they would obey those wishes given to them from the fellow man or women.
`P` Protect - To protect people and parent them.
`Q` Qi (chi) - Pulled from Chinese philosophy, so if one doesn't move for themselves, they aren't receiving life force, energy. The practise of Tai Chi brings this energy into self.
`R` Repair - To fix what is around them, rather than demolish and build again. To give people advice to become better people.
`S` Safety - To provide Safety for people or to sacrifice yourself for people
`T` Tidy - to be clean.
`U` Uniqueness - Like self, and being one with self
`V` Tick / YES
`W` Work - To work as a farmer would when the sun rises and today with modern jobs
`X` No - The right to say No and respect it from others.
`Y` Yes - Doing
`Z` Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs as described with N

Numbers and mathematics is a concept that folks would relate practising numbers or money. But in the world of English, literature, meaning and acts that an individual can make during their lifetime, 

`?` Not mean why, what or any form of question, it's a reverse C, which means Create.
`1` This is self.
`2` S, Safety
`3` B, Build
`4` An actual triangle, which means three bright lights. The concept being 1 star is for a lifetime of Good
`5` S, Safety
`6` B, Build
`7` A tick, Yes, like V
`8` B, Build
`9` I used to think this meant man, as the brain being the shape at the top and the line of the body, one I personally still like to treat as, but really it's a b, Build.
`0` O, for Obey
`$` A symbol for currency and doesn't mean anything in the stars, as the dollar was invented a number of years ago
`Â£` A symbol for currency and doesn't mean anything in the stars, as the pound sign was invented a number of years ago
`%` Percentage is a modern symbol
`^` If was in the stars, would mean Yes, a tick
`&` And is a word that has a symbol, so nothing in the stars.
`*` A star, well if this mean something it would be a lifetime of truths and good.

Defunct, don't mean anything other shapes for prose and english
`#`, `@`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`,`[`, `]` - Don't mean anything, just shapes
`/`, `\`, `-`, `_` - if in the stars, it would mean a single line, so self
`!` - Self and a truth star
`>`, `<` - Tick
`,`, `.` - dot, so single star, lifetime of truths
`~` - S, Safety

The rest of the characters you could figure out with the above. Such as ",', :, ;.

I've been iterating on these daily since my travels to Puerto Escondido in November 2023.

Feel free to do the same and research what words make better individual sense to you.
