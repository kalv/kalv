Star theory. In my travels, and work to improve myself. I've been studying different methods of finding peace in my mind and body. I started to read about constellations and the use of planetery bodies in how they can help meditate and heal ones body when you work out.

One aspect stood out to me, and that is how the stars form letters and that words would relate to the starting of these letters. Here are my findings and what I believe to be the best words that a Man, Women or Child can practise in their daily lives against, for the most positive impact to themselves and their family.

These would be acts a single individual performs rather than a group of people performing them.

These words have to be crystal clear that an individual can only demonstrate these as a word that doesn't have a pre-context word.

Another way to look at these is what do we people, see is absent from society today.

A - Answer - To give truthful answers 
B - Build - Working constructively on personal growth, relationships, or community projects
C - Create - Bringing positive things into the world, whether it's art, solutions, or a supportive environment
D - Defend - Standing up for what is right and protecting those who are vulnerable
E - Edify - To improve someone morally or intellectually. The underlying metaphor of "edify" comes from the Latin word "aedificare," meaning "to build."
F - Focus - One that focuses on their work during the day/night. To get the best focus, I find calming and relaxing the body and mind to help.
G - Good - Just go and do the good work to those around you. If you practise religon, it is a fundamental theological statement and appears throughout religious texts and literature influenced by faith.
H - Hunting - I had so many other words that could be here like House, Home but it's hard for an indvidual to practise this as an individual. So I've settled on Hunt, as one would hunt for knowledge, hunt for answers, hunt for food or resources as the early tribes.
I - Self - A single line would emphasize the importance of any human finding their inner self, being one person.
J - Just - The most difficult letter, there is not much in history with all languages but I order them this way. One must be Just. 
K - Kind - To be kind to those around you always
L - Tick (Yes) - This is not saying the word 'yes' but the act of completion of a good task. Seen in the stars, this is never a 90 degrees letter, it's a tick. A correct, complete.
M - Work - Self explanatory. Work is here under M as it's seen in mirror when seen in the stars. 
N - Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs, so a NO would be yes/yes with a given time (as O is a concept of Time). Imagine in your minds eye, joining L and L without the 90 degrees angle.
O - Time - Concept of knowing the time and meeting it. When you give a time, you do a task/work at that time. Even if it was with people that said we'll meet at mid sun when there was no clock. They would know the time and meet it. One aspect is clear with this and that is there is one clock, when the sun was born or when the GMT clock started.
P - Protect - To protect people and parent them.
Q - Qi (chi) - Pulled from Chinese philosophy, so if one doesn't move for themselves, they aren't receiving life force, energy. The practise of Tai Chi brings this energy into self.
R - Repair - To fix what is around them, rather than demolish and build again. To give people advice to become better people.
S - Safety - To provide Safety for people or to sacrifice yourself for people
T - Tasks - defining a task in the sun and completing it on time
U - Uniqueness - Like self, and being one with self
V - Tick / YES
W - Work - To work as a farmer would when the sun rises and today with modern jobs
X - No - The right to say No and respect it from others.
Y - Yes - Doing
Z - Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs as described with N

I've been iterating on these daily since my travels to Puerto Escondido in November 2023.

Assisted with Google Gemini to research many words and texts.
