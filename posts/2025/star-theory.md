Star theory. In my travels, and work to improve myself. I've been studying different methods of finding peace in my mind and body. I started to read about constellations and the use of planetery bodies in how they can help meditate and heal ones body when you work out.

One aspect stood out to me, and that is how the stars form letters and that words would relate to the starting of these letters. Here are my findings and what I believe to be the best words that a Man, Women or Child can practise in their daily lives against, for the most positive impact to themselves and their family.

These would be acts a single individual performs rather than a group of people performing them.

A - Answer - To give truthful answers
B - Brother / Babies - Caring for them, giving to them, respecting them, nuturing them
C - Care - To give care to others around you always
D - Do / Dad - Just do it, and as a Dad to always protect your children
E - Edify - To improve someone morally or intellectually
F - Family - Breaking bread, Giving food, providing a roof over their head)
G - Good / Go - Just go and do the good work to those around you
H - House / Home - To build and maintain your house for your family
I - Self - A single line would emphasize the importance of any human finding their inner self, being one person.
J - Jog / Joke / Jump / Just / Joy - The most difficult letter, there is not much in history with all languages but I order them this way. One must Jog/Jump for Joy and be Just. Joke is here as we all should make others smile and laugh.
K - Kind - To be kind to those around you always
L - Tick (Yes) - Seen in the stars, this is never a 90 degrees letter, it's a tick. a Yes. To complete a task.
M - Work / Mentorship (teaching) - Self explanatory. Work is here under M as it's seen in mirror when seen in the stars. 
N - Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs, so a NO would be yes/yes with a given time (as O is a concept of Time). Imagine in your minds eye, joining L and L without the 90 degrees angle.
O - Time - Concept of knowing the time and meeting it. When you give a time, you do a task/work at that time.
P - Protect - To protect people and parent them.
Q - Qi (chi) - Pulled from Chinese philosophy, so if one doesn't move for themselves, they aren't receiving life force, energy. The practise of Tai Chi brings this energy into self.
R - Remember, Right, Resting (The fundamental need for physical and mental recuperation)
S - Safety, Sacrifice, Sharing - To provide Safety for people, to sacrifice yourself for people, to share with people
T - Tasks - defining a task in the sun and completing it on time
U - Uniqueness - Like self, and being one with self
V - Tick / YES
W - Work - To work as a farmer would when the sun rises and today with modern jobs
X - No - The right to say No and respect it from others.
Y - Yes - Doing
Z - Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs as described with N

I've been iterating on these daily since my travels to Puerto Escondido in November 2023.
