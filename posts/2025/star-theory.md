My work in progress, star theory. In my travels, and work to improve myself. I've been studying different methods of finding peace in my mind and body. I started to read about constellations and the use of planetery bodies in how they can help meditate and heal ones body and mind.

One aspect stood out to me, and that is how the stars form symbols and that english words would relate to the starting of these letters. Here are my findings and what I believe to be the best descriptions of the symbols that are from the english words that a Man, Women or Child can practise in their lives, for the most positive impact to themselves in the lifetime.

The principle being that the Sun gives life and that when a child is born, their life is given from that energy like a tree. They then have their whole lifetime to work with the Sun.

These would be acts a single individual perform over their lifetime, not a single day. And acts that a group would never perform. Just a single individual.

These descriptions have to be crystal clear that an individual can only demonstrate as a word that doesn't have a pre-context or post-context word.

Most English characters don't work in the stars that have a bend apart from 'O'.

<div class="star-symbols">

`.` - Home
`A` - 1, first letter. Self. 1 Man, 1 Women, is essentially stating that there is one of you, you are your own man, you are your own women
`B` 
`C` 
`D` 
`E` 
`F` Family - The word doesn't even need to say any more
`G` 
`H` Nothing, this is really dot and not an english word with the letter H, making mention of it here as it reads the word 'home', 'house'. But is a dot.
`I` Self - A single line would emphasize the importance of any human finding their inner self, being one person.
`J` 
`K` 
`L` Tick (Yes) - This is not saying the word 'yes' but the act of completion of a good task. Seen in the stars, this is never a 90 degrees letter, it's a tick. A correct, complete.
`M` 
`N` Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs, so a NO would be yes/yes with a given time (as O is a concept of Time). Imagine in your minds eye, joining L and L without the 90 degrees angle.
`O` This is a difficult symbol. It's Time. Sticking to it, meeting obligations to time. Respecting time of one another. Knowing when time is up. From the origins of the sun dial, to the moon cycles and the modern 60 minute clock. Thoughts to depecit this as a planet is also referenced, but if it is, it's when the planet is in view as a measure of time, such as the moon.
`P` Nothing, really should be a triangle with self line, but people associate this with english words such as 'Parent', 'People', 'Protect', but those words are false.
`Q` Qi (chi) - Pulled from Chinese philosophy, so if one doesn't move for themselves, they aren't receiving life force, energy. The practise of Tai Chi brings this energy into self. Alternative is it's time with self. An O and a single line that could be in any of the 360 positions as a single line. A queen would keep a man to time.
`R` 
`S` 
`T` 
`U` 
`V` Tick / YES
`W` 
`X` No - The right to say No and respect it from others.
`Y` Yes - Doing
`Z` Double Tick (yes/yes) - doing two GOODs as described with N

Numbers and mathematics is a concept that folks would relate practising numbers or money. But in the world of English, literature, meaning and acts that an individual can make during their lifetime, 

`?` Does not mean why, what or any form of question, it's nothing in the stars
`1` This is self. A single line.
`2` 
`3` 
`4` An actual triangle, which means three bright lights. 
`5` 
`6` 
`7` A tick, Yes, like V
`8` 
`9` I used to think this meant man, as the brain being the shape at the top and the line of the body, one I personally still like to treat as, but really it's nothing
`0` O, for time
`$` A symbol for currency and doesn't mean anything in the stars, as the dollar was invented a number of years ago
`Â£` A symbol for currency and doesn't mean anything in the stars, as the pound sign was invented a number of years ago
`%` Percentage is a modern symbol
`^` If it was in the stars, would mean Yes, a tick
`&` And is a word that has a symbol, so nothing in the stars.

Defunct, don't mean anything other shapes for prose and english
`#`, `@`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`,`[`, `]` - Don't mean anything, just shapes
`/`, `\`, `-`, `_` - if in the stars, it would mean a single line, so self
`!` - Self
`>`, `<` - Tick
`,`, `.` - dot, home
`~` - nothing
</div>

The rest of the characters you could figure out with the above. Such as ",', :, ;.

I've been iterating on these daily since my travels to Puerto Escondido in November 2023.
