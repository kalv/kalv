What I would do if I was a Librarian today in 2025. Like I was back at Altwood C of E School in 1994.

I was inspired by a memory of a lovely [book store in Iceland](https://www.thebookstoreband.com), that had amazing live music with a great selection of books surrounding the music.

- [Last.fm](https://last.fm) for book readers to build community of book reading across the world, what did I read vs others that find the similar book.

- What is a modern library shelf that is digital and life long even if you don’t own the book anymore. We all read books throughout our life and we'd naturally forget. Being able to log these books in a digital way, by simply scanning the ISBN of a hard copy or work with data APIs, would allow us to store the book in our own personal digital library. Allowing us to share it with our children and friends.

- E-book publishing platform to allow anyone to become a publisher, write an interesting white paper, research, knowledge and then allow to be paid for it. The challenge with this is how to share how important the knowledge would be in the e-book, popularity. An author could easily tease and be educated at the outcomes a reader would achieve upon reading it and then others in the community could review cleanly and share what they learnt from reading it rather than opinion. NLP and other intent measurements could be applied on the style of review to filter out those that want to provide 'opinion', or even measure whether the review has the 'time read' against the book highlighting whether they truly read it.

- Being able to index a certain set of books or websites to search and ask it questions, based on NLP question/search/answer computer science. Like Google One box. This should be done ideally locally first and always private such that an individual could use this at a remote spa, or campsite.
