I had the pleasure of giving a talk at [LRUG](http://lrug.org) this month on [Websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets) and [Cramp](http://github.com/lifo/cramp).

I had some great fun using [Showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) creating the slides. It allows you to write the slides in markdown and serve them using Sinatra and some awesome javascript to make things look pretty. Making it full screen with Chrome worked a charm.

You can find the slides over at [http://github.com/kalv/lrug-websockets](http://github.com/kalv/lrug-websockets) and the example chat app that I built over at [http://github.com/kalv/yact](http://github.com/kalv/yact).
