When Wired came out in the UK a couple of months ago, I thought it would be cool to get in there for some of the work I do. The other month I was asked to be in a photo shoot about the work I've been doing in the twitter world as a developer for projects.

If you didn't buy the copy that came out in Nov 09 you can check out the crazy yellow shirt I wore [here](http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-magazine/archive/2009/12/start/wired's-guide-to-the-uk-twitterati.aspx).

It mentions Twitterfeed, where i've been working with the team to re-architect their back-end to support realtime, we have implemented Pubsubhubbub subscriptions and will be looking into handling RssCloud too soon.
