I started developing on a HP unix machine that had a green screen, I forget what processor it was, but all I had was a c-shell and I loved it. Things have moved on from then. I'm dumping out what I use today so I can look back later in the years ahead.

### Hardware

- Macbook air 1.8ghz i7, 4gb RAM, 256GB SSD
- iPhone 4 32gb, ARM Cortex A8 with PowerVR GPU (Apple A4)
- iPad Mini WiFi 32gb, ARM Cortext A9 with Dual core PowerVR GPU (Apple A5)

### Daily desktop software

- Mac OS X 10.8.2
- Reminders
- Calendar synced with Google
- Google Chrome beta - sticky tab mail for personal and another for company, irccloud for IRC chat
- [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home), so that I can use split panes and use the mac cmd keys (my brain is programmed that way currently)
- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) as a launcher and helper to quickly get to data (contacts, open recent files, clipboard history)
- [Tweetdeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/) mac for tweet deck
- iTunes for local music

### For Development

- zsh, with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kalv/dotfiles) for custom prompt, aliases, history search etc.
- [macvim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) for editing code, markdown and other text based files
- [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) to manage my Mac libraries and services (Thank you [Max](http://methylblue.com/) for this!)
- [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) first choice of db on projects therefore always running, MySQL and mongoDB manually turn off and on when I need
- [Redis](http://redis.io) always running, used as cache and backed for queuing
- [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/) to manage my ruby versions
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) for developing other stuff requiring lots of things I don't need every day ([Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS) compiling for example)

### Web services

- [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) for Documents
- Google GMail, calendar, contacts, docs (or should I say drive)
- Google Reader
- iCloud for Reminders and find my phone & iPad
- [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) - for dumping my brain on ideas / potential emails / things i want to continue on the iPhone
- [Github](http://github.com) & [Codeplane](http://codeplane.com/) for repo hosting
- [1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) for my password management
- [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) for reading
- [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) for saving bookmarks and sharing with team
- [Blogtrotter](http://blogtrottr.com/) to send our team pinboard links we save under certrain tags
- [Pivotal Tracker](pivotaltracker.com) for managing iterations with clients and internal projects
- Twitter / LinkedIn / google+ / app.net / Facebook - all for different things
- Spotify / We Are Hunter for music
- [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com) to queue my posts to social networks
- [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) - chat and aggregation tool used mainly with clients

What do you use and find it good for? :wq
