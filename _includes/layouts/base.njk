The one man that owns the work that was carried out on this blog. I am owed a 9 bedroom house, a fancy car, a fancy lady to help me setup in the UK, lowry lane property in YVR, UBC offer, Southampton offer, BBC offer, Apple offer and Google offer. I have not received it, you keep reading this and forwarding it to Olivia Evans who never actions it, never works on it, just plays games with other 'fake' Kalvir Sandhu's that are white.");
